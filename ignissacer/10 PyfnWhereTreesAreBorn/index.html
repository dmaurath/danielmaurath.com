    At the plant's first sprouting, and millennia following, the fresh green flesh was porcelain, so weak and vulnerable. All the plants of the entire world
    were so. And it was also so that a passing foot could end in utmost tragedy life of once great promise.
</p>
<p>
    Until one day, in an area on the outskirts of town, but once the middle of a formidable fortress of foliage, a tree bit back. Not so much did it bite in the
    offensive, rather it bit back via its defensive. The tiny plant popped back up. From a foot asunder it returned immediately to being taut and even a
    hair-widths taller. This little plant had defied millennia, had defied all that came before it. The plant defied its culture.
</p>
<p>
    A trampling herd of clumsy steps continued to parade over the tiny act of defiance in an unwitting attempt to return nature to normal, to quell the 5-inch
    defiance, to pacify it with passive aggression, for this herd had no conscience intention of it’s trampling—it is simply how things transpired in these
    times. Yggdrasil endured and grew tall. The sprout became a plant became a small tree. The nomad's machetes swung into Yggdrasil with a determined
    violence, but Yggdrasil bent absorbing the force, then returned the force from whence it came with a lash forward, and at the mark of machete attack
    Yggdrasil's skin thickened. Every machete's scathe was a hair-widths of improved thickness. The once supple skin dried, cracked, and hardened into a
    callous body of bark, as each scar of its bark was enclosed in a thick shield. The bark was a ferocious instrument of protection. The thickened, sheathed
    frontal cortex at once advanced the tree into modernity. Other frail thin-skinned trees fell to Yggdrasil's roots, and with a little help from its
    symbiotic friends absorbed the frail trees into its magnificence.
</p>
<p>
    A forest is an organism, where a series of symbiotic relationships come to define the forest as one interdependent organism. All are interconnected in a
    dense biological network characterized by a shared root system or via the benefit or detriment of shade and sun. The proliferate <a href="http://tolweb.org/Basidiomycota"><em>Basidiomycota</em></a> of the
    kingdom of <a href="http://tolweb.org/Fungi/2377"><em>Dikarya</em></a> served Yggdrasil. The fallen tress sustained Basidiomycota, which absorbed them and recycled the waste into Yggdrasil. From the anguish
    of the languish in death, the fallen tress allowed Yggdrasil to flourish and the kingdom of Dikarya to thrive.
</p>
<p>
    The small act of Yggdrasil’s defiance was a catalyst for the entire forest and the world's trees. Yggdrasil was pulled upwards into an insignificant bump
    on the earth's topography, yet the perception from earth was a steeple into the heavens. The massive leaves were gluttons on the trunk's behalf. The forest
    fell evermore to its knees in support of Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil's seedlings fed off the inferiority of death. They grew with the thick skin of their father
    and also survived to seed, so they were fit. The entire forest soon stemmed from Yggdrasil, which had become the dendrological heart of the world. The
    features of Yggdrasil both peculiar and advantageous had been pumped throughout the world, wrapped the world in the veins of barked trees and completed the
    circulation on which Yggdrasil had embarked. At the apex has the tree remained with every year incredible gains in size, though its leaves have long
    receded, Yggdrasil still stands surmount.
</p>
<p>
    The cycle of life is a brilliance thus unchallenged. Our linear artificial systems of human design pale into insignificance. The paving of earth with
    permanence that a tiny seed can in time split, is but one example of the disproportionate intelligence of nature and man. When the paved earth begins to
    breathe, then perhaps we can say we nicked the bark of nature.
