<p>
    I had exchanged the bread in hopes that Mikhail would resolve me of his company for a few weeks. Instead he came more often—optimistic after slight
    progress. But I did not eat his bread. I did not eat any bread. My life had slowed to the speed of a heavy pendulum swinging against a perpetual headwind.
    I struggled to shift a few inches in the morning. I stroked the smooth fibrous interior of the tree, felt another life moving slower into the future. A
    tree breathed but not in large visible heaves, rather through a long steady unhurried and imperceptible process. A tree spent years stretching its arms
    into the pleasant warm sun. I too had decelerated and could begin to sense the life of the tree. In this transition of timeframes, the present, past and
    future coalesced.
</p>
<p>
    “Knock”
</p>
<p>
    Was that a knock from an hour ago? Or a minute? I perceived at that present second, but a second was no longer a second. It was a reference relative to a
    different state of time and place. I responded relative to my experience of time.
</p>
<p>
    “Phew so you are alive. I have been here throughout the week knocking to get your attention,” Mikhail replied.
</p>
<p>
    “I heard only one knock and have only lived a day since I last saw you,” I felt the present quicken.
</p>
<p>
    “It has been a week, Allemanne.”
</p>
<p>
    “For you,” the present slowed.
</p>
<p>
    “Sign there.” Mikhail slid a legal document through the mangled opening of my porthole into the tree.
</p>
<p>
    The present quickened. The up and down, back and forth. Perception struggled to retain regularity.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me, may I ask what I am signing?” I asked
</p>
<p>
    “I just explained it,” the moment of “just” lost in my unreliable tracking of time) “Our company owns a small grove of trees on the edge of the Pyfn
    forest. We are renting them to your followers. They are not as old or spacious as Yggdrasil, but your followers want to live in them regardless. To grant
    them stay in the trees, the church requires your authorization.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am not a prophet. I do not teach or speak, or keep any company without reluctance. I am here in peace in my tree. I wait for my sons, to have a life
    together, but no, I am here to eat my bread and live in repentance of an extravagant lifestyle. My sons are just worthless consumers like the rest of us
    animals!” The present lurched forwards and stretched thin.
</p>
<p>
    “Calm down, Allemanne. Your words are blending into a fevered mess.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who are these followers? The ones who built that statue?”
</p>
<p>
    “They have come and heard your teachings. Now they want to move into their own trees. The only other species are located in the grove east of the newspaper
    printers. So we are leasing them to your followers. They call you the Virtuous Man and praise you for your ability to resist the seductive impulses of
    instant gratification, to overcome your<em> innere schweinhund</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am only another swarming gnat in this branch of the animal kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
    “They are passionate, and prone to emotion, so moral and intellectual arguments have failed,” gave Mikhail in quick retort.
</p>
<p>
    “I have become then a figure of their religion now, optimized to exploit their emotional predilections. Morale and intellectual arguments cannot overcome
    such magnetic pull of passion.”
</p>
<p>
    “We mind as well capitalize on them. You can sign the contract here at the bottom.” Mikhail pushed the document through the Sven-made mangled opening.
</p>
<p>
    I uttered a vitriolic reply, “I have never taught or spoken to anyone. I am here to try to live in peace. Tell those sycophants that I will sooner see
    their trees—Flashes of pain erupt in the stagnant tips of my limbs. I pause and grit my teeth -cut dow- Ohhh! – n” the pain heightened, “than have them
    blaspheming my lifestyle with their misunderstanding of my present life.”
</p>
<p>
    I did not remember teaching or calling to followers. SME<sup>TM</sup> became a sovereign virus. That was not Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak’s intention. The
    doctors had discovered a way to discern neurons associated with specific memories and then through a biological coding system, alter them. The doctors
    infected a starter neuron with an altering virus. Memories were identified by reconsolidating them, and then targeted. Neurons harboring the mental
    construct of doctor fired and ignited infecting the connected set of neurons harboring cancer and so forth. Forever these neurons would always follow this
    pattern, always reserve this pattern of firing potential, though a retrieval of the pattern would obfuscate with age.
</p>
<p>
    This was alteration not apoptosis. To kill neurons would risk death. The virus only altered neurons in such a specific and precise manner that it could no
    longer play a part in expressing the memory, and did so by inhibiting proteins integral to the recreation of the memory. So the memory was not
    reconsolidated or recreated; it was not replayed. Replayability is a novice myth, an endearing metaphor. The hardware of the memory is not destroyed,
    rather the ability for that hardware to express a specific and unique series of instructions is destroyed. Memories are instructions that like the
    intricate folds in origami can never in their complexity be perfectly cloned. In truth, SME<sup>TM</sup> was similar to the way a computer’s storage drive
    erases a video file. Arbitrary 0’s and 1’s are written over the memory items. The material that stores the 0s and 1s is not destroyed, just altered into an
    unreadable nonsense.
</p>
<p>
    An issue, however, arose with the stop code that prevents the virus from altering neuronal connections associated with unconnected memories, memories that
    should be left intact. Through numerous tests and brain imaging—all a part of the proprietary technique—the doctors traced the pattern of the memory and
    programmed the alteration code to only iterate <em>n</em> times, where <em>n</em> was the number of neurons per memory. Ergotism changed that. The
    interactions of the poison with the central nervous system had sent the pattern of alterations off course. Proteins folded in unpredictable ways, and from
    the folds a malformation emerged. The alteration code became a rogue virus infecting both short and long term memory. One’s perception of time is wrapped
    up tightly with memory. Lose short-term memory and you lose your reference point unto which all is referent. But it was worse.
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Allemanne, did you not eat the bread I provided you? Please you really must live this grovel. You are not well and I worry. I had my doctor come down
    during one of your manic writing states. He diagnosed you with frontotemporal epilepsy. Your drastic change in personality in relocating to live in a tree
    like a ancient saint, hypereligiousity, in spreading the teachings of a false greater external presence voiced in your head, and the hypergraphia,
    obsessive writing, were all together indisputable signs.”
</p>
<p>
    In addition, an overstimulation to my temporal lobe had created mental faces with no physical basis.
</p>
<p>
    My head panned around the tree’s core. Cursive in a 1-point handwritten font lined in a swirling vortex from my height to the floor and over the floor.
    Writings that had overflown from paper. Writings I never remembered. Epilepsy. Ergot. Memory Eradication. My pitiful mind. Soon it would be the tree’s
    mind..
</p>
<p>
    “Sickness or not, we still need these papers signed and then you can rest.”
</p>
<p>
    “You worry that I may not sign these papers or change my will since my son’s are dead.”
</p>
<p>
    “Dead?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, its been decades since I seen them.”
</p>
<p>
    “They left only two weeks ago!”
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot recall much about that time.”
</p>
<p>
    “You had sent them on a senseless quest to return the missing painting.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail pulled the papers out from the tree.
</p>
<p>
    “I am going to inform the Abbot of your dangerous condition. Your time in this tree is done. I will not let you die in there.”
</p>
<p>
    “Could you bring me some mittens and socks too? I fear my feet and hands are so cold, I cannot feel them.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, yes, I can bring you some.” Mikhail’s voice creaked in despair and misfortune. His mentor was a beggar.
</p>
<p>
    I laid languid for hours (hours of an outsider as I no longer had an accurate perception of time). Only occasionally could I manage to eat or relieve
    myself. I did not remember moving, unsure if I had ever moved or only forgotten.

		</div>
<p>
    Gabriel clamored off the <em>schildkroete</em> and onto the beach at the foot of the lush forested mountains. There was a worn path clear of vegetation at a
    peculiar width of a man walking. He followed the path, the borders overflowing with vegetation well over his height and imagined himself as an explorer
    bravely slicing away the encroaching plants during his forging of a new route to an exotic location. He would plant the flag of his sponsoring country and
    make his name immortal. A vast metropolis, a school, a suburban street would all bear his generic name. Man granting man infamy in pathetic hopes of being
    granted their own.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel continued along the path until sunset. He had been provided some food and clean drinking water. He stopped for a break. He sipped the cleanest and
    freshest water his lips had tasted. The food from Terenverde was light in mass but filled him in only a few bites. He decided to camp for the night. A
    cave, his destination high up on the mountain, loomed at least a full days journey away. He had set out at midday so expected to reach the top by tomorrow,
    mid-day.
</p>
<p>
    The only technology known to belong to the smugglers other than instruments of murder was a massive telescope of unknown origin. The telescope sat at the
    top of the mountain and was a means of spying on the city for the smugglers. The telescope was Gabriel's first destination.
</p>
<p>
    No one in Terenverde believed the smugglers could have designed anything like it. Whenever a new citizen caught the glint of the sun in their eye
    reflecting off the telescope’s lens, an immediate explanation was given by the nearest Terenverdean, “That is the old smuggler’s telescope stolen off an
    ancient ship of a more purposed people that sailed the Ocean until it shipwrecked into the rocks on Terenverde of the mountain.” Or, “that telescope was
    stolen before the time of <em>peacebots</em> from an absentminded inventor at the edge of Terenverde.” Or, “that fell off a massive airship that was tossed
    in a storm.” Or even rumors spread that some smugglers had actually assimilated into society despite their primitive intelligence. This was the speculation
    of overly imaginative children.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel treaded with care, with an expectance of a sudden attack.
</p>
<p>
    There would be no sudden attack. Indirect forces of the town had exterminated the smugglers. The peace bots excluded them from their fulfilling their
    purpose and so nature, no longer in need of them, by design, caused horrific civil war. Caused is a strong term. One must eat. Without food, the brain
    retreats to instincts. The smugglers separated into familial tribes and factions, and were willed into murder. One arbitrary tribe connected by the fault
    of and simplistic connection of a perceived bloodline invaded an arbitrary geometric space of another tribe, which invited arbitrary violence. Tribes
    relied on arbitrary beliefs in arbitrary creations of stagnant fearful imaginations to prevent despair, which would surely arise if all this was all for
    nothing. A wrong arbitrary belief was death, for an affront on a belief is an affront of the person. Yet were these beliefs not meant to prevent death, to
    propagate eternal life? Were the beliefs only justifications for murder of nonconformists and genocide? The propensity for these beings to escalate so
    thoughtlessly to the extreme was considered a fault of pets in Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    The sun warmed a temperate temperature. The river’s long winding secret was no longer hidden in Gabriel’s higher perspective. He climbed up above
    Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    The telescope had detached from its sturdy home and become irreparable. The thick lens was cracked into a thousand random paths. Its enormous weight sunk
    it deep into the moist ground.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the telescope was a cave. This was not a smallish opening that may have served a small family, rather it was a grand opening fitting of a gateway to
    a new city. Gabriel sensed the painting was near.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stepped into the cave and fell. He tumbled through the air. One moment he was headfirst, another feet first, another headfirst, another feet first,
    another headfirst, another at an angle leading with his right shoulder. His back left shoulder collided into a protruding rock slab, which shattered his
    left humorous, tore the ligaments from their hold and rendered his arm useless.
</p>
<p>
    At that moment, the pain was there but his worries greater. He had slowed but-
</p>
<p>
    SPLASH!
</p>
<p>
    He lands in a shallow pool, struggles to swim with one arm while not moving the other too much. The pain breaches an imperceptible threshold as his brain
    floods itself with endorphins. He's numb, yet surprised and injured in a deep cavern in the hallowed hollows of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
    “Dr. Allemanne, wake up, please wake up!” Mikhail’s frantic voice urged me into present consciousness.
</p>
<p>
    I often slept. My limbs numbed. Everything slowed. The tick-tock phase of perception from fast to slow ended. My life held in abeyance.
</p>
<p>
    “Your followers have all been murdered!” shouted Mikhail.
</p>
<p>
    “I insist that I do not have any followers!” I shouted in return.
</p>
<p>
    “They have been murdered! Did you not hear me? The entire sect wiped out in bloodied fashion. The police believe it was an act of single man. You must
    leave the tree. The murderer may be coming here next. I insist you leave. I will pull you out myself!”
</p>
<p>
    “This is nonsense, Dr. Allemanne. I believed in our friendship, but what was you, is no longer you. I am not even sure why I stand here now and talk to a
    personality as aberrant from the man I knew as a stranger. But I am here with my last vestige of hope. Please leave the tree for your safety. Your boys
    will hopefully return soon and this disturbing episode will end.”
</p>
<p>
    “My limbs are too solid and weighted. I cannot lift them and have been unable to feel them for days. I have not moved from this position in, in a very long
    time. My perception is a deception but of late; all has felt only slow and never fast. Even in these slow times, then I say, it’s been a long time.”
</p>
<p>
    Angered at my yearlong replies, which to him comprised translucent rumbles behind silence, Mikhail rips off the last remnants of the door; he invaded the
    tree.
</p>
<p>
    The interior of the tree was empty. There was not food or clothing, just my tattered pants. I sat slouched against the side of the tree near the opening.
    My hands and feet had merged into the inner bark of the tree. Mikhail ran his hand along my arm and onto the tree. It was difficult to tell where my body
    ended and the tree began. My limbs had become limbs of the tree. My head sunk into the green flesh. Thin tentacles of bark wrapped around my head melting
    into the supple green wood of the tree. Beneath my body was an outline of young and vibrant green arboreal flesh, like that of a sapling or young tree. My
    bare torso was untouched, yet human, save for a single lime green tentacle entering my abdomen like an IV. The tree absorbed me in a deliberate and
    intentional process.
</p>
<p>
    All lose mass to trees. CO<sub>2</sub>’s mass departs from people and becomes tress. Trees are not clever conversions of dirt, but even more clever
    conversions of air. I had eliminated the intermediate steps and become the tree: my magnum opus!
</p>
<p>
    “I-I-cannot believe this. How is this possible? You are becoming the tree,” Mikhail exasperated.
</p>
<p>
    “And the tree, I. For one who has learned to listen to a tree, no longer desires to be a tree. Instead they desire to be nothing, as they were. That is
    home. That is happiness.” replied I many years later in deep and haunting reverberation through the village.
</p>
<p>
    A follower from a far land by the name of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500">Moksha</a> knelt at my tree and recited foreign words, here translated, “I respect you when you stand alone. You are
    like the forsaken. Not like hermits, who have stolen away out of weakness, instead you are like great solitary men such as Beethoven and Nietzsche. In your
    treetops rustle the world, your roots rest in infinity; alone you do not lose, but strive with all your life for one thing: to represent yourself through
    demonstration of principles and in building your own form.”
