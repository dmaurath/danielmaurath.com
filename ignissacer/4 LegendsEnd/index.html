		<p>I found a depressing scene at <em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em>. Hoards of rats not customers covered the floor. Orders were not called out, rather a sorry oven coughed and smoked. A damp musty smell of rot, unfixed leaks, and stale flour swathed the scene.  The sight of an abandoned <em>La Boulangerie</em> recalled reality. I had lived this place in memory and in memory it was always an exciting and pleasant experience, but now I knew those times were gone, forever gone, and that permanence deeply saddened me. This was never to be a place where I was young for I would never again be young. This was never to be a place of tourism, for that time had its turn and is past. This was a dead place. I broke down into tears. I would soon join it. The tragedy of life: a gift at times so spectacularly beautiful yanked away at a moment’s notice or slowed into a different sort of drawn out agonizing pain.  Yet without unintended death, our art would suffer and all would suffer. Art finds much inspiration in death.  Without death, resources would be scarce and regardless, murder would reach a plateau of accepted normality. Stepwise my logic had progressed.</p>
		<p>At his peak, Renomme was the most famous baker in the entire world.  Today he was known to bake a weeks worth of bread for a single day or would bake only pain or only rye or would sometimes not bake at all wandering the streets in search of a cat from his childhood. He was without family, without friends, without customers, without much function of his memory. Maybe a rat will endure a maze for bread, but not a member of an instant society. Some bakers helped him, but had businesses they needed to run and could only do so much for their former idol. The remaining envious considered his fall justice.  Renomme should have retired and entered a home but he was a legend and the end of a legend does not come with ease.</p>
		<p>I rubbed salty tears from my world-worn face and vowed to see this place into a proper closure. My peripatetic travels that day had drawn me here for some purpose. So from that day on for many weeks I returned to the shop of my youth. Now, to find Renomme.</p>

		</div>
		<p>I soon learned Renomme often wandered the dense web of cobbled lanes, peaking down every alley and lifting every mat in front of every door of the many busy bakeries. Customers were not happy to oblige him their place in line for the mere satisfaction of his deranged curiosity.</p>
		<p>“I have found Chaton!” I announced as I approached Renomme peering desperately into the window of a butcher’s shop.</p>
		<p>“Oh where? I have searched for her all day?” questioned Renomme.</p> 
		<p>His Mediterranean tone was only slightly visible beneath an uneven coating of flour like my Father had once worn. His bristled black hairs, a few white, stuck out from under his white hat, while under the hat remained only a far receded hairline. His nose was narrow, long with a small bump and below a smallish mouth. Short legs that matched the short arms supported his stout frame.  His clothes were disheveled and unflattering of his awkward roundness.</p>
		<p>“Chaton was asleep in the window of your shop as I past, nestled in the comforts of a deep <em>corbeille à pain</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh we must hurry back then. If this claim rings true, I must reward you”</p>
	<p>I led the renowned Renomme back to his shop and on arrival the fleeting quality of his memories again appeared. Despite the memory afflictions, Renomme had retained his youthful sight. He navigated the twists and turns of neatly stacked loaves of miche with agile precision and disappeared into the kitchen, Chaton forgotten for another day.</p>
	<p>Renomme fired up the ovens again and was in argument with himself. I took his opportunity of the chef-distracted to pull the stacks and stacks of loaves fast fungus fodder out onto the street. I arranged them into a precarious tower and placed a sign in front signaling passerby’s of a unique bread deal: loaves for mere donations. With refrigeration and careful cutting, they would withstand the weekend, which was a time to be social, and to be social is to eat.</p>
	<p>People eat and drink with others to mutually enhance experiences that alone can be mundane. A first date is often paired with coffee or a fine wine. Humans are the sum of their metabolic processes and these processes are heightened by coffee or ignored by alcohol, but created by bread. So one did not want to run out of bread during the long weekend, when few to no shops were open. Many villagers picked up the extra loaf from Renomme for a modest donation, and afforded an old man some bread of his own.</p>
 	<p>A beautiful young woman passed me as I erected the bread tower. Her eyes were a beautiful brown and hazel, a stark similarity to the wares of an Alpen chocolatier. I knew her. Or did I? Perhaps I met her on my last visit, but there were many young women who passed by and I never remember seeing such a sumptuous woman, one whom I would have remembered. Could a woman with such glow be erased so easily? I glanced into the store, nothing but a bread maze. I hurried in but she was gone. Had I lost so much time in my thoughts? I must return. I must find her again. Not even the anticipation of the morning’s first drink gave me such excitement.</p>

		</div>
	<p>Through the winter I came everyday to see her but she never came. Everyday I found the phantom cat. Everyday I waited two long hours in the afternoon in front of <em>La Boulangerie</em>em until Renomme threatened to call the police or his grandson to remove me, a man his elder, from loitering. Everyday I would see her walking down the street, with a confidence exuding from her every closing strut. Everyday it was but a second’s deception, morphing a common woman into my muse. Everyday I accepted this and returned to my worrisome family.</p>
	<p>Gabriel came often to try to pull me from my misapprehensions, “Father, you must not chase delusions of your degrading mind,” he pleaded.<p>
	<p>“Delusions! I am robust, and in perfect mental health, do not think I do not know what I am doing”</p>
	<p>"You stand there everyday awaiting an unknown, an unseen, an unimportant.”</p>
	<p>“Absolutely not! I await a woman, and despite being an old man, I want to end this life with love, with the reds of romance, not the dark grays of a murky dismal loneliness"</p>
	<p>"End? With Romance? I want to understand this. Had I seen the woman, maybe I could understand, but please just leave, come home. We miss you.”<p>
	<p>"Eh, lies, rotten lies. I had thought to spend more time there but not in that environment. Dante and you run everywhere. You incite punishment. You move in a tornado through my house with such disturbance all the thoughts in my head are shaken out, spread out on the floor, trampled, and imbibed an early death."</p>
	<p>"For once you are not viewing the world only through the distorted future of a bottle bottom! No,  instead you chase sober delusions, but a move from the bottle, despite direction, is a positive move according to us."</p>
	<p>"Through the bottom of the bottle? Speak not in ruse, or ill chase that with a bruise. And not these sober delusions you articulate"</p>
	<p>"Your rhymes are childish. I cannot come here everyday and shed a tear for you. Please do come to your senses.”</p>
	<p>Gabriel left in frustration. </p>
	<p>“I am on the brighter side of the fences, you will see in future tenses.”</p>
	<p>I went inside, frustrated with another fruitless day and thankless children.</p>
	<p>"Renomme, so why have you not retired? With such success, you should be in a yacht, back in France, in Nice, sipping wine all day and enjoying the luxury of a life of hard work"</p>
	<p>"Idleness on a bed of pillows wallowing in a swallow of water? No thanks! My work is not work in the sense you believe rather a purpose. Without this purpose I am without life"</p>
	<p>"Baking is your purpose? There is nothing else you would rather do?"</p>
	<p>“Yes. Everyone must have a purpose and mine lies in the art of wheat and yeast: bread. Without a purpose one work’s for nothing, and happiness impossible to maintain.”</p>
	<p>“I see truth in your reasoning. I have since abandoned my work for a bigger purpose: to find this woman. I do not seek a mate, or maybe I do? I do not know what answers she may have or motivations she may provide me but I have an intuition that I must find her. What about your family Renomme, were you ever married?</p>
	<p>"Enough with this conversation. I must check the miche." </p>

		</div>
	<p>Resolute in my confidence and dedication I remained. I never missed a day, two hours a day, from the first flake to freeze to the last one to melt, I waited. Two hours a day without my sons. Two hours a day extrapolated over a winter amounts to days wasted. I missed days of memories. I welcomed a premature death to loiter in front of a bakery of senility. I spent a winter, my last, heaped in anticipation for a woman I would leave in death as my wife left me. I would leave the woman with the threat of alcoholism and the care of children she had no stake in. Again I looked at my sons through a bottle darkly, but a bottle of failed consideration rather than spurn.</p>
