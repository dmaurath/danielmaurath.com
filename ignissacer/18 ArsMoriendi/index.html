	<p>
    Dante departed, knife in hand, through the natural foyer of the cave, and ventured deep into the section of the cave constructed by the smugglers. The
    smugglers had long been extinct, but Dante anticipated new inhabitants in the narrow pathways. He reused the lights from the poachers of the Pyfn forest.
    Light revealed a smooth tunnel in many shades of dusty brown, with a concave floor, worn in the middle by years of eroding footsteps. An occasional sign
    glazed in mud and cave dust allowed him to self-navigate the chaos of twists and turns. Scrapes in some instances were unavoidable. He did not think about
    his brother, only the painting.
</p>
<p>
    Since he disagreed with his brother’s belief, he deemed that a justification for homicide. The dialectic of belief or no belief is itself as simple-minded,
    when one is too ignorant to understand the essence of belief, which is wavering and fragile, subject to sudden upheaval and deletion, nothing as
    substantial as life. People too easily abstract enemy beliefs onto the faces of people and kill those faces as a means to killing those beliefs. Human life
    comes to mean less than orthodoxy.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel landed in a brilliant surprise before unsuspecting Dante. Gabriel clawed forward with the last of his energy onto shore and went still. Dante
    rushed<strong> </strong>over to Gabriel and rolled him onto his back. He noticed Gabriel’s arm hanging lifeless and crooked on his unconscious body.
</p>
<p>
    Samekh approached my tree. He digressed on his new appointed position as a state psychologist, where he spent his days assessing psychopaths to
    ensure they were indeed psychopaths. He spent his weeks entangled in the personalities of the conscienceless, which was dangerous for a man whose persona
    was an ever-changing expression of those he came into contact with. With consistent interaction, he began to adopt the mannerisms, ways of speech, beliefs
    and values of his company. This is how he had survived as boy, but it had evolved into a dangerous and unpredictable lifestyle. For most of his younger
    years, he became silhouettes of clinical patients, of the mildly neurotic and troubled clients he spent his days with.
</p>
<p>
    “I drowned a cat yesterday, and did not feel anything. I never have killed a cat before but always thought I would feel bad. In fact I felt relieved. The
    cat had been crying all night, really ruined my sleep. So I went outside, grabbed it behind its neck and held it under the water. Horrible, right?
</p>
<p>
    The assimilation with the tree had stretched my voice to an imperceptible low frequency. The valleys and hills of the frequency were stretched into a map
    matching a lifetime in both drama and length. Decades may pass before the slow vibrations complete my reply. However, in my current omniscience, I can
    confirm the opprobrium of his actions.
</p>
<p>
    “I believe I know why I killed the cat, why I am I. I read a recent study about the ability of people to assume the values, beliefs and attitudes of
    fictional characters. They call it experience-taking. The experience-taker becomes a simulator of a subject’s thoughts, emotions, goals, behaviors and
    traits. Is that not what I have done my entire life? I have only ever taken, no merged others experiences, made them my own.
</p>
<p>
    I have forgotten my own self-identity. Everyday I awake unsure of who I am or who I will be. Others could not withstand my endless silence. The presumption
    of an eternal trait drove and induced the others to talk in an endless stream, which flowed full of deep secrets and desires that only encouraged a more
    fuller version of them to develop within me. The only constant is my pursuit of an understanding of the mind. Is that I? Could that be my true identity? I
    cannot be sure when I also awake to a drowned cat. Is my transcendence of the self-other border a vector to living an infinite variety of lives? Am I but
    an empty receptor as result of my reduced self-concept? Or is this realization proof against my fictional “I”? Yet again I cannot ascribe the death of a
    cat to any of my patients, only to this “I.” My life is a grand “experience-taken.” I am a thief of lives like those psychopaths I have come to become.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps these monsters and I reflect the truth of the world as one gone mad. I do have not any intuitions about my disposition tomorrow, but am equally
    unsure to aver it as pleasant or sour. I have no desire to kill cats or worse people. I have returned then here after quitting my position with the state
    and plan to search out those obscure, “good people,” those who appear selfless and kind, though not so naïve to accept the evil their minds have
    considered.
</p>
<p>
    When I see baby, I am disgusted. I know the evil and harm it will cause others. The despicable selfish methods it will employ to hurt others for its own
    gain. A baby is a reminder of how disfigured one becomes through life. It is a reminder of the illusion of individual persons. Now, is this my personality?
    Am I distinct in my self-knowledge of being an amalgamation of man? Is my true identity one that searches for and assumes personalities then sits beneath
    the surface until it’s had enough and searches again? I’m hesitant to say I am in a frenzied mental state for I believe I was born into one. All the lay
    people are but fragments of a single mind “humanity” that transcends space and time. They are stranded in this space and time, and I have the ability to
    supply a compendium of the race of man, each individual comprising a fragment of myself. I represent an unparalleled consciousness of the multiplicity of
    man. I am a tangible reflection of the true nature of man, a single substance of billions of fragments, and must ruin the belief of innate individuality.”
</p>
<p>
    His stream of moral consciousness spilled upon me. Dr. Samekh's mind had absorbed so many thoughts deliquesce was natural. Clarity disturbed the static of
    his pretension.
</p>
<p>
    “That is it! I must reveal my true interest in you. I have only come now to realize it. I must have your Bosch painting, <em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em>
    , for it portrays this idea of a single conscious in an accessible way. With that painting I could convince everyone of this truth. At last the solution to
    my existence is illuminated. Tell me at once where it is!” demanded Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “That painting was an unfortunate victim during my initial episode, and is destroyed, only ashes” I replied, but of course, was not heard. The subtle tones
    of my reply emanated over years.
</p>
<p>
    “Your sons must be retrieving the very same painting. I daresay I will murder them if I must, but that is a desire I struggle to repress. I must control
    this responsibility of mine to express humanity. I must find a way to view the entire stream instead of a single connected current of molecules within that
    stream. Otherwise I risk hypocrisy. I must find your sons. For only Bosch dared to paint man as he is on the inside, and only through that painting can I
    appeal to the masses. I will not leave immediately. First I must remedy myself of this murderous demeanor by imprisoning myself in the monastery. There I
    can let a more empathetic personality infect me. This atrocious mind of mine is tiring to withhold.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh hurried with purpose towards the monastery, away from me, away from the tree.
</p>

<p>
    Gabriel struggled to encourage life. His breath was slow. His heart beat strong but overworked with the little oxygen. His right lung had collapsed. He
    needed to rest at least a week until his lung healed, if he could last a week. He escaped unconsciousness and saw a blurry dark figure that sharpened into
    a creeping shadow. Dante had finally returned to leave Gabriel again to death in exchange for riches. Dante approached Gabriel’s dismal body, just
    functional enough to maintain consciousness yet feigning unconsciousness.
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, Gabriel, brother, are you all right?” Dante questioned with muted concern.
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, I, I just, I am not sure why I reacted so violently. I let myself go. I allowed my rage to assume control and let the idea of being an angered,
    justifiably violent person control me. The exhilaration of the chemical impulses conquered my consciousness like a series of stiff drinks. I apologize and
    will do all I can to prevent such an emotional conquest.”
</p>
<p>
    “I, I forgive you Dante. I apologize for hitting you so hard with the candleholder,” said Gabriel as he struggled to exhaust air over his quivering vocal
    chords.
</p>
<p>
    Dante cared for Gabriel. He shared his food with Gabriel whom had lost his in the fall. After they ate all the food, Dante spent hours gathering the Snow
    Ball mushrooms that carpeted the walls and floors of the cave. Each morning, which had come to be defined as the time he awoke in the light-deprived
    conditions, he stroke a charcoal slash above Gabriel’s bed and went out gathering all day throughout the caves.
</p>
<p>
    The slashes numbered 8. Dante only had a week of rations, now depleted. They must survive on the snowcaps now. Dante left to gather them from the nearby
    corridors of the cave. Each day his search stretched deeper into the cave. The carpet of mushrooms diminished.
</p>
<p>
    “Drip”
</p>
<p>
    “Scrape”
</p>
<p>
    “Drip”
</p>
<p>
    “Drip”
</p>
<p>
    “SCCRaaappe”
</p>
<p>
    Foreign noises disturbed his morning walk. Dante’s heart fluttered as it accelerated. Fight or flight initialized.
</p>
<p>
    The air vibrated in sync with hundreds of flapping wings.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s breathing accelerated. He froze though hardly conscious that he had. His eyes fixated in direction of the noise, his body statuesque in demeanor
    not regal.
</p>
<p>
    Hundreds of wings became thousands of wings became millions of wings.
</p>
<p>
    Quick successive breaths.
</p>
<p>
    Eyes unblinking.
</p>
<p>
    Pupils engorged with all the light they could absorb.
</p>
<p>
    Faster heart.
</p>
<p>
    Faster breathing.
</p>
<p>
    His heart,—once the only rhythm in the deadened silence —became overwhelmed by the approaching storm of bats.
</p>
<p>
    “I am in a cave; it must be bats,” thought Dante.
</p>
<p>
    At crescendo the bats never arrived. The sound disappeared. The wings faint, then no more.
</p>
<p>
    Sensory deprivation near that of Flotador precipitated hallucinations. To survive, they had to move. Gabriel’s breathing improved. The 8 tally marks were
    not fruitless.
</p>
<p>
    “I feared you would never recover, and I would be forced to abandon you,” confessed Dante.
</p>
<p>
    “I owe you my life, brother”
</p>
<p>
    “You owe me nothing. I almost took it out of triviality.”

<p>
    Gabriel’s legs had already begun to wither as his efficient body cannibalized the muscle tissue to supplement the malnourished diet of weeks of feasting
    only on mushrooms. He rose onto his weak legs, steadied himself and ventured forth into the meandering tunnels of the cave.
</p>
<p>
    Further in, the cave provided still only mushrooms and even less light. The light from the opening was lost behind the sharp curves and valleys of their
    journey. Dante struggled with hallucinations he hid from Gabriel. He hallucinated food: spicy curries, roasted almonds, the succulent juicy bite of a
    handful of blueberries, a refreshing hoppy Trappist brew dancing its complex flavors across the tongue.
</p>
<p>
    The hallucinations coupled with depression and a distressing loss of hope left Dante often lethargic and reluctant to awake each day. Overwhelming thoughts
    of again facing a day and the endless trek unnerved him. The anxiety became greater than the worry of not finding food. He began to accept his fate.
</p>

		</div>
<p>
    Gabriel gathered the mushrooms on this, the 23rd tally mark. It was the first time. Dante insisted that Gabriel never do it, since he would not be able to
    recognize the Snow Balls from their less edible cousins, <em>Agaricus xanthoderma</em>. The two species had only subtle cosmetic differences so the easiest
    method of telling the two apart was to break the fruit body from the stem. The <em>Agaricus xanthoderma’s</em> stem would turn an immediate bright yellow
    that faded white into the end once holding the cap, while the Snow Balls would not. Without light Gabriel had to rely on the less precise method of smell.
    The <em>Agaricus xanthoderma</em> had a subjectively foul smell, not of licorice, but not of anything analogous. It simply smelled of “to be avoided. ”
</p>
<p>
    The <em>xanthoderma</em> were rare in the cave, which made the mushroom gathering easier, but encouraged less safe protocol in the comfort accompanying low
    probability of unwanted effects.
</p>
<p>
    Dante plodded through the tunnels as a starved mute. He never spoke and ate very little. Dante was on a course to starve, not survive. His share of the
    hunt, a few mushrooms mashed and mixed with salt scraped from the walls, lay in wait of rot before him, like his meals of the past 3 tally marks. If only a
    few particles from the abundance of light, could permeate the void they wandered.
</p>
<p>
    Dante felt warm sunlight wake him from a long night’s rest. He opened his eyes to nothing. He opened and closed them a few times to ensure he was opening
    them. But black. Again the hallucinations teased him.
</p>
<p>
    Dante stopped speaking as he developed Dysarthria, a motor control disorder caused by a lack of vitamin E. Difficult speech became incomprehensible slurred
    and spastic sounds that came out frustrated and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was starved. He scraped Dante’s share of the salty mushroom mash into his bowl and finished it off. As Gabriel finished, Dante made an unexpected
    movement. His nose twitched like a rabbit near fear. He snatched his empty bowl from the ground, swiped his finger along the inside gathering a viscous
    mound of the mash on his finger, and held the noxious mixture to his nose. His face snapped backwards.
</p>
<p>
    The mushroom mash did not smell of anise. Gabriel had gathered the wrong ones. He lunged and knocked the empty bowl from Gabriel’s hands.
</p>
<p>
    “nin-nin-n-NO!” he screamed, “puOHsin. Wrrr-OngMucsh rum”
</p>
<p>
    The mushrooms grew thousands of tiny spikes that prodded and poked Gabriel’s intestines worse than a fastidious fruit-buyer. Gabriel lay curled up in a
    permanent hunch, since positioning himself any more or less forwards left him in even more agonizing pain. The mushrooms spikes seemed to only dig in
    deeper. Gabriel attempted to vomit the poison out, but only succeeded in dehydrating himself and turning his shirt into a putrid mess.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s in his acute disturbed state mumbled incoherently from visions.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel cycled through fits of cold and hot sweats, his body failing to maintain temperature as his worn immune system battled for his life in his gut.
</p>
<p>
    The brothers commiserated in the absolute dark of a foreign cave deep within the earth, without real food and far away from the comforts of home. Their
    suffering mirrored that of their ergotic father. Had there been fire, they would believe they had found hell, and their journey to here was a cruel
    purgatory.
</p>

		</div>
<p>
    The damp lightless grave unraveled into a string of vibrant green fields stretching to the foot of imperceptibly tall peaks. Dante and Gabriel sat high
    above on a steep cliff, a castle sat in the center of the valley, the eye of a funnel. Seven wooden gates adorned the castle. Seven opportunities to
    improve their present predicament. Though much had improved in the unraveling. Dante’s delirium dissipated; Gabriel grew gesund — ills elicited. They were
    perched in dreamful strength; two twins descending through an inferno.
</p>
<p>
    Dante took the first brave step with a rigor mortis grip on the tufts of grass above his end, he slid down the side of the cliff onto a narrow path, half a
    Dante’s food wide. He leaned forward, arms wide, pressed in desperate intent against the crumbling cliff. Gabriel joined him, arms splayed as well.
    Together they slid, one dangerous slide at a time.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s foot slipped as the path beneath his foot zeroed into a dust storm swirling meters below. They continued to slide with hesitant steps, never
    allowing the lead foot the full weight of the endeavor.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    They slid on through the crumbling path, each step a gamble, their odds ever lessening in their favor. One foot crumbled or another, but not yet both.
    However if both feet feel, one would catch the other in a moment of cliché suspense. A fall. A scream. Emptiness. A hand, another hand. Saved! The grip
    would loosen and dwindle with the importance of the character to the story. Or the grip would strengthen inhumanly, and a happy relief provided all.
    Neither Gabriel nor Dante slipped, they slid and sling along the declining and widening edge. The dull edge blunted into a Gabriel’s foot width.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    Sweat binded dust to skin, and flowed over the curves and features of their young faces, betraying eye sight for decreased body temperature. Flooded eyes
    coped as the hands clung yet to the eternal slide.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    Their sliding journey ceased as the path widened enough for their shoulders to swivel perpendicular and carry the brothers along their descent into the storm.
    All the greens beneath the steep slope were lost in the pale browns of a sand and dust storm. Violent capricious winds carried particles into Dantes hair,
    Gabriels eyes, their entire bodys exfoliated by a brutal beating of sand. Erratic gusts often caught them unsuspecting.
</p>
<p>
    As Dante slide onto a wider path an aberrant wind threw him face first into the rough uneven dirt, tiny rocks scraped against his skin.
</p>
<p>
    They slid with the whim of the wind. Back and forth, tossed around as the apathetic wind does, as a wind disinterested in human stakes in the world. The wind
    pushed Gabriel into face-scathing falls, and Dante did little to prevent his own current of beatings. The push and pull of the wind ripped moisture from
    the once lively faces of the brothers and deposited a thorough mix of gritty sand and dust particles into every exposed crevice.
</p>
<p>
    The brothers descended into the valley, resisting the dust as Anthony resisted temptations. Their tumultuous journey only worsened. A violent storm erupted
    above their heads and unfurled an ocean of rain. The wind continued to blow sand and rain as they sunk ever further into a deep mass of liquescent earth. Beneath the earth swam a creature with the appearance of a <em>schwimmer</em> enlarged nine times. Unusually large worms, gluttons of the mud, feasted upon all that passed by their blind mouths.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel and Dante moved forwards with careful step as they felt the muscular python-like worms wrap their strong pliable bodies around and then through
    their entrenched legs. The vile smell choked out even the stalest air; a sulphoric haze hung above the surface, a by-product of the worm’s insatiable
    digestion. Worried they soon too would be transformed into naught but sulphoric haze, atoms forever reappropriated to the cosmos, Dante and Gabriel moved
    quickly over the dense dam of knotted tree roots and into a flat desolate post-apocalyptic land blighted with haunting pits spitting molten gold.</p>
<p>
    The dynamic land spun new surprises. Dante and Gabriel escaped the enveloping, choking stench of worm haven for a sweltering rapacious land now suddenly given way to sullen swamps that awaited their chance to usurp every atom of the brothers humanity.
    Within the swamps animals emerged in their abominations of infected imaginations. Beneath the foul water glanced the twins bodies, lifeless bodies devoid
    of oxygen thus life, clinging to the surface just within reach of all that they needed but never were able to reach, so close, but never so far away.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Bleiben sie noch zwischen die neun Zeilen.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The distance to their goal, the castle, disintegrated with a sudden descent into an even fouler miasma of fermented death. Fire rained down. Small
    explosive rocks drove Gabriel and Dante scrambling down a steep slide into an abyss of granular mud, heavily textured with the genesis of decay. Every step
    disturbed the solidification of the boy’s medium. Their legs pushed against a burgeoning resistance until the tired muscle fibers spasmsed in their own
    resistance. Exhaustion. Stress. A confluence of negative emotions and states weighed on them. Incinerated rocks still fell, but their steps could not. They
    were trapped in a kinetic hell. Dehydrated, malnourished, the brothers trudged in futile circles approaching death as they circled the finality of their narrow
    existence. Within the trap, they pondered the nihilistic truths of the contrived life burdened by their personal tragedy, a normality of humanity.
</p>
<p>
    The necessitous brothers collapsed onto the back of a beast, exhibiting a three-dimensional creature that only distinctive imaginations, your imagination,
    could concoct. Rescue though Gabriel. Rescue though Dante. The beast deposited them in a cavern of ice, without an end; an expanse of deepening ice, cold,
    dry, and unforgiving awaiting its latest permanent tenants.

<p>
    Gabriel awoke from his straw bed. The room had a pile of straw, a short circular wall of blackened stones in the middle, and some pots in the corner. The
    walls were an organic natural material unfamiliar to Gabriel, perhaps peat. In the middle of the roof, was a small opening for smoke, and light.! No
    murmurs of a delirious Dante either, or feelings of spikes snagged in his intestines. No there was not pain, there was a light! Gabriel’s mind cycled
    through the possibilities attempting to make sense of the light. Had he at last met death after first traversing hell? Or was he trapped in a dream just
    beneath his miserable conscience? Did the cave collapse and by stroke of luck catch him in this air bubble? None were plausible, yet one unthought was the
    truth: rescue.
</p>
<p>
    The smugglers were not extinct, only on the brink.
</p>
<p>
    A smuggler by the name of Drummond Greaters entered Gabriel’s primitive hut.
</p>
<p>
    “I fear your life’s luck has been exhausted. 65 miles of tunnels beneath that mountain and all but 5 miles have been abandoned. Our security and only
    reason for survival has been the hiding of that single route from Telescope Point to here, Tyffn, the last remaining smuggler village. Yet in blind luck
    you wandered the correct path and our scouts found you just in time.”
</p>
<p>
    “How long have I been here?”
</p>
<p>
    “Years…”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel became disturbed in his surprise.
</p>
<p>
    “…months, days, hours, what does it matter when your fate is decided? If you must know, we brought you in four nights ago and this is all we found with
    you.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond handed over to Gabriel a tallied stick.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel disoriented from the new surroundings, and unusual answers from his new host, stared blankly at the stick trying desperately to catch his mind up
    on the current circumstances. He had many questions, but first reached out to grab the stick. The stick had a series of notches on it, which numbered 42 in
    all. It was the number of days they had subsisted on little more than salty mushroom mash and water from the feeble stream.
</p>
<p>
    “Luck did not save us, the stream did. We followed its path that reassured us of life somewhere on the other end, as a stream must have a source we
    believed. Luck is too easy of an explanation, propagated by those too lazy or narrow-minded to find the correct answer.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond had long lost his penchant for argument. He believed life too difficult to spend it idle conversation that only stressed him further. So he
    shrugged.
</p>
<p>
    “Well then few of us smugglers are as intelligent or resilient as you. Many died wandering the tunnels. During the long sieges of my village near Telescope
    Point by Terenverde, we took the woman and children through the caves to here, Tyffn, just an outpost at the time. I was a solider, a rearguard who hung
    back two kilometers. I was ordered to not let anyone through my tunnel as long as I lived. After many days navigating the hundreds of miles through the
    cave without any food besides the mushrooms, the children would suffer. First, their speech slurred and they convulsed like drunks. Then the myopathy set
    in and they were too weak to go on their own. Their muscles were cramped, stiff, and completely dysfunctional. A series of rickshaws would make long,
    arduous trips carting the child casualties to Tyffn. Adults, especially women, were more resilient since they had more body fat capable of storing vitamin
    E. But we do not need to worry about sieges anymore, only a few hundred of us remain now. Many moved onto cities for less dangerous opportunities. The only
    ones left here are the old, like me, or those without any talents, perhaps too slow in the head to make a decent thief.”
</p>
<p>
    “The guide at Terenverde referred to you as “beast-machines” but you not beast or machine. You’re very much human.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is how they justify annihilating us.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in a way felt sorry for these criminals, just trying like everyone else to make sense of life and find their own path of least resistance to death.
    After all, they could have left him to certain death in the cave.
</p>
<p>
    “But there is hope in a final desperate attempt. There is an auction today. We must finally sell our most-prized possession. The reputation of the Tyffn
    auction house is not what it used to be, but I sure saw some fancy coaches moving into town today.”
</p>
<p>
    “<em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>?” asked Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you know about that painting?” Drummond’s tone swayed serious.
</p>
<p>
    “I need it. It was stolen from my father and he’s holed up in a tree until I bring it back.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well I have never seen it, and do not want to discuss it further. Shall we visit your brother? He is well.”
</p>
<p>
    “You seem to know more than you let on. I need any information you can provide. I can pay a very large sum. My father abandoned his riches for an austere
    life in a tree, but left me a substantial sum. Name your price.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond walked over to the flap of rough, brown cloth blocking the doorway. He peaked his head, his eyes darting about assessing the risk of his
    environment like an anxious mouse about to snatch some spare crumbs outside its hole. Satisfied, he sat down next to Gabriel, scribbled a number and then
    handed it to Gabriel. Gabriel took the piece of paper, nodded and then returned it.
</p>
<p>
    In a whisper that necessitated Gabriel to strain his hearing, Drummond spoke, “Today a coach will arrive and take my family away from here to a safe place,
    a place that I need not divulge for risk of safety. But it’s not a smugglers’ village or Terenverde. It’s a city, where we can start anew. Sure I may be
    middle-aged but I have some working years in me and want honest work now. This coach cost an exorbitant amount. I funded it by selling a piece of
    collateral, that painting. Smugglers had a substantial collection of art at one point meant as collateral. It was hidden and only certain smugglers new its
    location. That way we could prevent methods of mass eradication and have something to sell that was valuable enough to help us move and start again away
    from the prying eyes of Terenverde. Terenverde knew they could not kill all us without first discovering the paintings. Not even torture would work. We
    were bound by oath. A dealer has paid for the painting by the name of Gamut. He will arrive today and pick-up the painting in exchange for a coach ride
    outside of Tyffyn.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel knew there was something corrupt about Gamut. He had sent them to die in caves for a painting he had already bought.
</p>
<p>
    Drummond continued, “If anyone else finds out I have betrayed the smugglers they will kill me, but it is a risk I must take. I cannot allow my children to
    follow in my footsteps. They will not live criminals, societal cockroaches hunted and squashed without any thought other than that of disgust in the mess
    their death had made. The deal will happen during the auction. There are only a few hundred of us left and all will be there for the auction. The auction
    will also provide adequate disguise for the arrival of an extravagant coach. Many coaches are scheduled to arrive as the world’s most affluent art
    appreciators are expected for perhaps the last great auction by the once great Smugglers. I will meet Gamut behind the auction house at precisely noon to
    make the exchange.”
</p>
<p>
    “Where is the painting now?” Gabriel inquired.
</p>
<p>
    “I will not say, but I saw your knives and am sure someone of your talents can find a way of acquiring the painting, but not until I have made my deal. I
    may be old, but I was a solider and lived a life of constant prey. I can and will fight if I need to.”
</p>
<p>
    “No worries, I intend no violence. I am sure I can arrange a deal with Gamut. I know him well and though he directed us into near certain death, I do not
    believe in shedding any blood for money.
</p>
<p>
    Dante rested in a hut matching Gabriel’s in austerity. Most of the symptoms of his vitamin deficiency had been relieved. Two smuggler women entered the
    hut. The women’s smiling faces were dragged down by the years, and short white hair shimmered with experience. Both wore plain but clean dresses. They
    looked to be all the clothing the women owned.
</p>
<p>
    “How much do you think that painting will fetch us today? Dagamu says, ‘I think we’ll be able to retire to a small town near the water. Fish during the
    day; enjoy a glass a brandy at night. Finally have a moment to rest. Won’t that be great?”
</p>
<p>
    The woman rolled Dante this way and that way as they changed the sheets, wetted his forehead.
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, I’ve been at this too long, we both have, for such dreams. I never envisaged a Bosch in our possession.”
</p>
<p>
    The name “Bosch” pulled Dante into consciousness. It couldn’t be a coincidence he thought. This is the painting Gabriel and him were after. He looked for
    the source but saw only an empty room.
</p>
<p>
    A man entered. Dante recognized the eccentric dress immediately as that of Dr. Samekh. He approached Dante’s bed.
</p>
<p>
    The room morphed and was again inhabited, “Well, I say it will sell for 25 geld. What to do you guess?” said Dagamu.
</p>
<p>
    “I prefer to wait without expectation.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, Veretu, make a guess, it’s fun.”
</p>
<p>
    Veretu continued to work furtively ignoring Dagamu.
</p>
<p>
    “We can make it a bet. Both guess the price and then if I am right-”
</p>
<p>
    “I said I have no desire to guess. I’m more concerned with what were eating tonight.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh Veretu, have some fun-”
</p>
<p>
    Her voice trailed off like a faltering echo. The room was vacant. Dr. Samekh appeared above Dante. He smiled a callous smile, stared through his wide
    rimmed lilac rims nestled under his purple fedora, stretched his yellow tweed arms, and grasped Dante’s neck firmly between his white leather gloves. He
    choked Dante, with that fixed callous smile. A bright light encased the doctor in a mellow glow.
</p>
<p>
    Dante struggled.
</p>
<p>
    The gloves squeezed harder and cut off the air.
</p>
<p>
    The hands that once stroked a lover, passed money to the poor and pulled a fallen boy up, were now instruments of murder.
</p>
<p>
    Dante beat his arms against Dr. Samekh. He tried to scream, but there was no air to pass over his vocal cords. He tried to call to the women but not even a
    suffocated scream emerged. He was breathless. He knew a fight would only kill him faster, but he couldn’t resist. Once he had committed to fight, he would
    fight until the end. He squared up a punch that caught the doctor lightly on the chin. The doctor still smiled. He climbed onto Dante and placed his knees
    onto Dante’s arms.
</p>
<p>
    The weight was unbearable. Dante moved his arms with all his strength, but they only squirmed in place.
</p>
<p>
    The moment of struggle had become timeless. He didn’t know how long it had been. The light faded. Here it came.
</p>
<p>
    What had he ever done to the doctor? He always considered him deranged, but never violent. Did it matter now? The light around the doctor faded.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s brain became a high-voltage cacophony.
</p>
<p>
    Silence in inactivity.
</p>
<p>
    “Ughhckk-co- cough”
</p>
<p>
    The light flicked back on, no Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    The women rush to his side.
</p>
<p>
    “You all right? Need some water?”
</p>
<p>
    “I think it was just a bad dream, Veretu.”
</p>
<p>
    “Where’s the doctor?” Dante’s first words spurted out..
</p>
<p>
    “What’s wrong? We don’t have a doctor? Our Shaman was taken away in the last raid.”
</p>
<p>
    “No there was a doctor here, not a medical doctor but a psychologist, a mind doctor. He was strangling me. He had a yellow tweed coat on.”
</p>
<p>
    Dante read obvious confusion on the women’s faces.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh wore a grey burlap robe. Thick brown twine accented his waist and a hood draped heavily around his head. It was morning prayer, at 5:30AM just
    before sunrise. Out the window he saw the tree of Dr. Allemanne.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh had joined the monk’s to facilitate the adoption of their disposition, but one cannot try out being a monk, it is a lifelong decision. Hesitant
    about returning to the world imprinted with the minds of the many psychopaths he counseled, he saw no other choice but to imprison himself among the monks.
    Every morning, afternoon and night he prayed facing south watching over Dr. Allemanne, that sprawling hand of 100s of branches before the night sky.
</p>
<p>
    Dante recovered from his ephemeral visions of death and began to plan his escape. The smugglers as hospitable as they were, could no longer afford anyone
    trust. They took precaution in placing a guard outside Dante’s and Gabriel’s huts. Everything they needed was brought to them. Neither of them were allowed
    out.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel also planned escape. He dug through his things and found his knife. He needed a sharp blade to cut through the peat of the hut.
</p>
<p>
    The razor sharp blade slipped and nicked his finger. Blood flowed out a half-inch gash on his hand. He buried it in the thick sticky mud of the ground
    floor to stop the bleeding
</p>
<p>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s escape was quite easy but unsurprising considering his captors were themselves criminals. The smuggler society had once stretched through thousands
    of tunnels vibrant with the pace of a dangerous life, but now only a weak few survived the legacy. Many nostalgic, anticipated a quixotic return to the old
    days—the grand price of the painting their expected savior. However, not all were too foolish in their dedication to let an enticing offer pass them by.
    The guard, a father in his late 50’s, had seen the glory days of the smugglers but also many knives at his throat and buried in the backs of his friends.
    Like any noble parent, he wished the best for his offspring.
</p>
<p>
    Not all smugglers recognized Dante as the son of Dr. Allemanne. In his face though, the guard saw the face of Dr. Allemanne, who he knew as a wealthy man,
    a face that often appeared in tandem with the face of diplomats, politicians, CEOs — the important people that other dominant cultures followed. The story
    of Dr. Allemanne’s materialistic demise had not trickled through the tavern conversations that comprised the smugglers information network. The guard
    believed he could extort quite a sum from Dante in return for Dante’s escape. Since the smugglers had long been in decline, they had been living off what
    they could hunt or the little their slow wrinkled hands could steal. What kind of a sum should be demanded? The guard did not know.
</p>
<p>
    Dante handed him half of his father’s trust.
</p>
<p>
    Before his trip, he surprised Ms. Steinhurst disguised as a criminal and forced her to take out all of Dante’s trust. Believing a criminal had actually
    stolen the money, the bank’s insurance replaced it and Dante increased his fund by a fraudulent 50%.
</p>
<p>
    He lost that 50% to the guard. The guard provided directions to the forest and a map for his escape. He even gave Dante some of his clothes so he could
    blend in better. The guard would take the same trail. Even at the height of its decline, the smuggler’s code was still enforced with expected brutality. He
    could not be caught. The auction would soon begin.
</p>
<p>
    Dante ignored the guard’s recommendation. He wanted to find Gabriel, but feared he would be recognized under the scrutiny of a questionable request of
    release. Instead he made his way to the auction house. He had his full trust in coin to purchase the painting—the gateway to a pleasant second life with
    his father. The painting held so much hope in it for the smugglers, for the brothers, for the many wealthy citizens of the world now arriving at the most
    infamous auction house in the world.
</p>
<p>
    House Dekales in Tyffyn was world renown. If one wanted to find the most rare or exotic of goods, House Dekales is the only place to go. Sure one must
    ignore the illegal manner in which the goods found themselves at the House, but for those of the type that could afford to attend these auctions, pushing
    out such thoughts was a daily task.
</p>
<p>
    House Dekales was nicknamed the “House of Extortion” sounding at first listen to “House of Execution,” a planned misconstrual by the House’s adversaries.
    The smugglers stole a 17th c. Monet or roman statue and the only way to have it requited was to win it at an auction. Police could not be involved for it
    would break the unwritten code and surely disrupt the marvelous marketplace. The wealthy considered the occasional extortion then a mere fee for their
    entry to this elite and exclusive market.
</p>
<p>
    A cobbled road wound up the craggy knoll from which the cantilevered House Dekales perched. Road maintenance had been long disregarded, so dodging a piece
    of wall or withstanding a brutal pothole was expected. At the top of the hill, before the entrance of the House, parked the coaches of the wealthy. A vista
    emerged of the incredible density of the Pyfn forest, which disappeared into blackness before meeting the horizon.
</p>
<p>
    The House had been carved into the slouching mountainside, the entrance many stories below the peak of a bell tower. From the front, the House looked to be
    only a couple stories tall but in fact raised four times that. The smugglers did not build the house; it was an artifact of royal wealth millennia ago when
    man was audacious enough to spend a generation turning an inhospitable boulder into a magnificent home.
</p>
<p>
    The entryway was grand and retained its medieval technology. Two giant wooden doors splayed out in front of a half-oval doorway that could accommodate
    twenty men marching through side-by-side. Dangled just inside, above the entryway and lying in wait, was a barbed iron gate meant by design to keep
    undesirables out, but principally used by the smugglers to keep the desirables in, if anything suspicious occurred.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel dulled his knife with the constant push and pull through the peat walls of the hut. Now he looked for Gamut.
</p>
<p>
    Dante approached House Dekales,
</p>
<p>
    “The auction will be begin at. . .1 geld! Now do I have a bid of 1 geld?”
</p>
<p>
    The auction began with some cheaper items only meant to draw out the suspense. Everyone wanted the painting. No one wanted a decorative pot or drinking
    mug. Today, they had traveled the many miles and risked their dutiful upstanding lives for only the most prized item that would be the blather of their
    friends and covetous acquaintances, the painting <em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel reached the base of the hill holding up House Dekales. From this perspective, he saw how the road of disrepair curved around the hill and then
    split into many arterial roads that could take one to any of the seven seas in the world. Gabriel believed Gamut would hide his chariot somewhere along
    this road for an easy escape, likely behind the house where there wouldn’t be any traffic or eyes peering from above.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s heart beat fast. He was sure he would be caught. There were too many of his father’s friends in the crowd. He pulled the hood tighter, but the heat
    of the congested room was unbearable. Sweat flowed steadily down the contours of his face. He wiped it again and again in rhythmic fashion.
</p>
<p>
    A vase sold for 10 geld. It was the second to last item.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel made his way along the road, and saw in front of him Gamut standing behind his chariot examining the painting with Drummond. Though difficult to
    see from his vantage point, Drummond appeared not as a man bartering freedom for his family but as a man grieving over their tragic fate. Gabriel crept
    closer, positioning himself behind some stray rocks behind the two men. His bright blue eyes against the pale glow of his skin caught Drummond’s eye.
    Drummond pretended to not notice him, but as he accepted the large pouch of coin, he gestured towards the front of the chariot. Gamut nodded and they
    walked towards the stallions with their backs to Gabriel. Gabriel’s chance had come. He could sneak into the back of the wagon.
</p>
<p>
    After much ceremonial pomp and circumstance, the painting was unveiled and bidding began at the unheard of 100-geld price. The first to bid was an exotic
    dilettante prince of some poor dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
    “101 Geld, “called out a middle-aged matron behind Dante.
</p>
<p>
    “105 Geld,” echoed in the corner.
</p>
<p>
    “110 Geld,” snapped at the previous bid’s heel.
</p>
<p>
    And so it began. The smugglers hope, Dante’s hope, the hope of rich and famous hung on this event.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel crept into the back of the chariot. He could hear Drummond outside telling an anecdote about a horse he had as a boy. As the conversation drew to a
    natural close, he rapped twice feigning a fidgety demeanor. A warning, Gabriel thought. Gabriel stowed himself behind some luggage. His finger throbbed in
    disproportional pain.
</p>
<p>
    “201 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “211 Geld, new bidder!”
</p>
<p>
    “250 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “300 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “375 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    Dante held out.
</p>
<p>
    "A warning, 375 million," announced the auctioneer.
</p>
<p>
    The bidding was methodical among the anxious palpable crowd.
</p>
<p>
    Every new bid followed by collective exasperation.
</p>
<p>
    “300 Geld, 400, 425, 450, 475, 490, 525!” The impatience pushed the bidding up, faster.
</p>
<p>
    “550 Geld!”
</p>
<p>
    “600 Geld!”
</p>
<p>
    “650!”
</p>
<p>
    “750”
</p>
<p>
    In seconds, the cost doubled, then tripled, burgeoning to a bid of 1500 Geld.
</p>
<p>
    The bid surprised everyone, surprised Dante though it came from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
    “This is to be a record, my fare men and women. Fair warning, I am selling it this time. Going once, going twice,-”
</p>
<p>
    A commotion erupted at the back of the hall. An old smuggler with a torch barrelled through as fast as the crowd could part.
</p>
<p>
    “Its a fake. I’m sorry I sold the real one to a man from Anderseite. I’m a terrible traitor and come now to admit my grave mistake, please do, as you must.
    Oh, I am such a despicable traitor!” Drummond thrust himself forward, opened his grip and hurled the torch at the painting.
</p>
<p>
    Drummond was struck down with a successive shots from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
    Smugglers returned shots at his attacker, a distinguished man brandishing an antique pistol, far too slow to reload.
</p>
<p>
    All manner of defensive arms emerged as the scene collapsed into chaos of fleeing, death, blood, and visceral action.
</p>
<p>
    Dante abandoned the suffocating robe and ran around two men exchanging death by sword.
</p>
<p>
    A shot is fired in Dante’s path-
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had been on the road for two weeks stowed in the back the coach, and unable to carry out his plan of stealing the chariot. His hand throbbed
    beneath the makeshift wrapping on his hand. A disgusting odor and sign of blackened gangrene skin infested Gabriel’s nose. He gagged at the sight. His cut
    was infected. The gangrene ebbed down his arm, from the knick on his finger and invaded his blood. His body succumbed under the stress of a fever, weakened
    further by the weeks of a poor diet. Gabriel lay in a damp pool of sweat subject to an early death and evident of his existence borne into a trap.
    Alessandria wondered eternal.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh, now after his vows known as Brother Vehere, kneeled down for his evening prayer. Throughout the day, at each prayer he noticed a gathering in
    the yard below around Dr. Allemanne, the tree. The crowd grew with the forward arch of the sun and beyond the suns disappearance. Now the tree was alight
    in the gleam of a hundred angered torches.
</p>
<p>
    Rumors and gossip were sins, and conversation consisted rarely of anything but interpretations of the Bible, so all the news Dr. Allemanne heard came from
    what he overheard patrons discussing after the end of the service. That evening before his final prayer, he heard of a gathering at Yggdrasil by Peir and
    his followers.
</p>
<p>
    Gathered around the tree were insular minds of the average populace, contributing nothing to culture and on a pathway of returning to the earth having made
    no change upon the world. An intellectually inferior man of action, Peir Gerlofs led the group. Considering his obvious lack of appreciation for education,
    he strived to make cogent arguments about the path of society, but always equated this path with that which birthed a genocidal maniac and his both active
    and passive followers, all of whom were accessories to a murder of millions. Peir Gerlofs and his followers, like those of the manic, stared with the dead
    eyes of an instinctual animal, unable to actively process the true meaning of their actions.
</p>
<p>
    Peir Gerlofs had long preached claims of vivid images of death and suffering that came from the supposed black magic in the tree. Subsequently the media
    reprinted these images encouraging them to be repeated frequently in conversation, heightening the emotional arousal in the sensitive average; they became
    victims of their own subconscious acting irrationally and protective. Though the probability and likelihood of black magic very low, the ruminations of
    potential discomfort were too difficult to ignore, thus logic was ignored.
</p>
<p>
    Martina had founded this group but could not cure their emergent toxic ideology. They were a volatile mass driven by pluralistic ignorance, resistant to
    all argument and truthful revelation. Martina tried to point out the flaws of their reasoning, but was ostracized. No single member willing to admit that
    they do not believe what they believed all believed.
</p>
<p>
    Match strikes, torches thrown, and in seconds am I bleeding energy with the efficiency of a healthy flame. The bright orange and reds are reflected in the
    heavens.
</p>
<p>
    The timid crowd retreats surprised by the fierce wave of splendid energy warming their cold faces.
</p>
<p>
    Yggdrasil transforms into a beacon of light, radiating red-yellow into all corners of town.
</p>
<p>
    Red-yellows color the sky.
</p>
<p>
    Burnt wood fills chill air; smoke rises into the cosmos; cinders fall.
</p>
<p>
    Alessandria waits at In Vino Veritas for Gabriel, whom time will never bring.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh kneels, eyes-closed, with slow steady breaths at final prayer.
</p>
<p>
    The longest, thickest branch, Yggdrasil’s mast, swings disconnected from the trunk and obliterates the tower.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh and the church collapse onto Peir’s, onto his torched followers.
</p>
<p>
    An ethereal song fades in. The notes tell the tale of life. The music expresses joy itself, sadness itself, elation itself—emotions stripped from their
    contextual stories.
</p>
<p>
    “A sky deep azure, a navy of shifting waters mirror with iridescence like cascading ocean waves. So vast. A silhouette forever on the night sky, behold
    me!”
