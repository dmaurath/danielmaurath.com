	<div class="content">
<p>“Nichts ist heiliger, nichts ist vorbildlicher als ein schöner, starker Baum. Ein Baum spricht: In mir ist ein Kern, ein Funke, ein Gedanke verborge, ich bin Leben vom ewigen Leben. Einmalig ist der Versuch und Wurf, den die ewige Mutter mit mir gewagt hat, einmalig ist meine Gestalt und das Geäder meiner Haut, einmalig das kleinste Blätterspiel meines Wipfels und die kleinste Narbe meiner Rinde. Mein Amt ist es, im ausgeprägten Einmaligen das Ewige zu gestalten und zu zeigen.”</p>
<p><em>[“Nothing is sacred, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. A tree says: Hidden within me is a core, a seed, a thought. I am life from eternal life. Unique is the trial and throw, which with the eternal mother dared me, unique is my form and the veins of my skin, unique are the smallest leaves of my treetop and the smallest scars of my bark. My purpose is to form and show the distinct uniqueness of eternity.”]
</em></p>
<br>
	<p>Yggdrasil was a cathedral of the forest. The hollowed core rose 10 meters above my head. An apartment in the city was not as spacious on the inside of my natural dorter. I did not hold the space as a demonstration of wealth, rather respected the sheer brilliance of nature’s architecture. Fractions of light shone through small holes made by burrowing insects and animals.</p>  
	<p>In the tree, I had the monks robe for clothes, a pile of straw for sleeping, a few candles, many journals with some pen and ink, and a months baking of Renomme’s <em>Pain dé Seigle</em>, which stayed fresh in the chill atmosphere of the tree’s core.</p> 
	<p>The bread was the extent of the legacy of the Renomme. <em>La Boulangerie de Renomme and Renomme</em> had burned, consumed by an audacious oven fueled by an absent mind. A few days before the fire, I made a farewell visit collected some bread and another Pain, the feline of diversion.</p> 
	<p>Far from my straw pile I had set up a garderobe. Twists and turns of the trees trunk had made a Y-shape, and where the two lines of the Y came together it was deep enough, and wide enough for me to sit down comfortably. I carved a large hole out, and deep down into the grounds, where no smell could disturb my life’s remaining reflection.</p>
	<p>Often I lay on the mat and listened to the voices transcribing my auditory hysteria into a journal or more. Often I found myself waking from a state not of sleep but consciousness, staring at nothing, with not even a fool’s guess of the time or day and a seconds processing to construct a mental model of the present. Often I became detached from memories’ recollection and architecture of time and space.</p>	
	<p>Woodcarving became not a hobby, only a skill I acquired out of necessity, if one could even say I had acquired it. So the door to my hollowed home was rudimentary, a carving of cave men who invented the spoon, and not yet the knife. My life as a whole had become rudimentary.  The padlock that secured the entrance was its most advanced mechanism. Together with the moss and knots that ensconced the rough outline of a hinged opening, it protected me from world, from the nosiness and greed, the perpetual whine of a society fit to be swine.</p>
	<p>I did not wish to abandon my sons, and had not forgone surgery, life-saving surgery, just to grant them a few more memories.  Not memories of my health that would tease them with many years together to only strip them of any hope when I passed at the verge of an apparent recovery, but memories of days that they would keep till the end, memories to serve as the reference point for all memories to come.  But I was torn. I had to abandon this greed, and omit my possessions, live a Monk I must, or so the voices spoke as they trailed off at the precipice of entropy. I must show them how one is to live.</p>

	<p>My eccentric transition had earned me a quizzical fame, and one devotee was a doctor. He was a clinical psychologist whose apparent method was to make you the doctor while adopting the role of patient. Without much else to do in my hollowed tree he figured his daily lectures would be gratifying; that our dialogues—if it is possible for only one person to speak in a dialogue—would enlighten a breakthrough in psychological science and in his enigmatic being.</p>
	<p>“My mind is a puzzle with dynamic pieces, shape shifting and color changing, in order to hide the truth beneath an overwhelming exponential set of possibilities”</p>
	<p>This was a quote spoken during one of our ‘dialogues’ during which he always sought answers to his own mental afflictions rather than cure mine. Not that I asked him to cure them or for me to cure his.
 	<p>I pushed the large, sectioned, hinged root that masked my entrance up to see his face, not my dried fruit or ever persuading and begging children. Without room for another body, or any wish to expose my sanctuary, we began to carry out these conversations with the root section propped open wide enough for voices to exchange bot nothing else.</p>
 	<p>"As a child in Moscau, I was a drop of the ocean without another drop in my company. I was a drop separated and left alone to moisten an expansive desert. I was alone despite all odds contesting it,” began our first conversation.</p>
	<p>"That is quite sad,” I replied.</p>
	<p>"I walked to the train station and followed families around. I pretended I was their son. Often though I was caught by the conductor or manager and sent back home, to the streets. This continued until I learned the conductor’s routes and schedules and moved car to car or stashed my boyish body with the suitcases. I always dressed in brown to blend in better. At first the families would scold me for having run from my own, but my persistence was for young parents too saddening to ignore. Soon their scolds were invites into a world I only dared to dream of. </p>
	<p>In this world were a house, a yard, siblings, warm meals, pet dogs, but best of all: love. Love was a foreign emotion to me. Deprived of me by my family and the entire world beyond the empathetic families. For weeks they treated me as their own genetic sequel. I never dared to say anything that would again tear love away from me. The families tolerated this for a while because an orphaned child not immediate in his will to speak is no surprise, no alarm. However, I never spoke. I never overcame whatever reasons they had: I never learned to, or was a foreigner, or my voice was the only thing that was mine and could not be taken away so I refused to endanger it. Some even took me to the hospital to see if I was mute. Of course I was not. When alone with the other children, they prodded me with any prodding objects at hand, usually sticks or tableware. But nothing came out of mouth, nothing but a drip or two of blood as my teeth pierced my lip. I bit so hard I wounded myself to mask emotions urging for vocal expression. At the sight of blood, the children screamed, announcing the event to the parents who came to my defense and swept the children away from me. I was alone then even in a house of love. I stayed sometimes weeks or even months until the children carried out a successful framing of me.  Staunch in my refusal to defend myself, they returned me to the train station, where I played out of my show again with the reward of another warm bed, and full house of empty love. This went on for years until I found my second passion, but for a price no human should endure.</p>
	<p>“Why did the families not take you to the authorities?”</p>
	<p>“Despite my accused offenses, they could not resist my pleads and pathetic begging to avoid a return to the orphanage.”</p>
	<p>“You lived in an orphanage?”</p>
	<p>“That is a time I do not wish to discuss.”</p>
	<p>He paused, a deep expiration, and continued.</p>
	<p>“My passion best expressed as psychological intrigue began with the bookcases of one family: the Gerlofss. They were less a family and more a couple who enjoyed the company of a pair of dogs. Frank was stout but not fat, with the physique of his bulldog Rooney. Louise was athletic and strong, with the physique of her German shepherd, also named Louise.</p> 
	<p>They bought me a dog of my own, a wispy stray with ragged hair and a constant snarl. He was given to me quite ill and died after only a few months due to a chronic illness. In those few months, he suffered all I have suffered as an outsider in this world. They handed the dog to me and said our misery would be our company. His illness brought new meaning to their words. They did not have pity on me, rather an unknown ulterior motive. I was given a sick dog as a friend and together we had to sleep on Tankred’s old, worn bed. Once at midday we were fed a can of dog food. They insisted that it had all the necessary ingredients for strong growing boy. Other times they said, “puppy.”</p>
	<p>They dehumanized me. They caninized me. I was given a collar and roped to the wall in the room. To use the bathroom I had to scratch at the door! However, the room I was in was an old study. The inimical Gerlofss did not value books or knowledge and so they let me stay there undisturbed in the study, which once belonged to Louise's father, a professor at the state university. There I found meaning for my intrigue and studied all the theories of the walls of books. I was there for years and read the library through twice. I gave myself a Masters level education without the toxic influences of professor’s forced interpretations. I spun new webs of intricate theories:  theories only able to be postulated by a brave brain that does not falter in face of potential failure or daunted by employment prospects. I had to unleash myself from this home to learn more.</p>
	<p>I, the dog, succumbed to one last act of dehumanization. I spread butter along the thick twine rope securing me to the study floor. I placed the rope in my mouth and bit, hard and strong, with an intensity and fervor demonstrating all the anger I had for my position and for the way I was treated— for my desperation to escape. I ground and tore until I felt my teeth would give, until my teeth bled. My teeth pressed with such pressure, as if fate was behind each set pushing them into an eternal love-filled bond. At once they met and rubbed out the few stubborn twines. By morning I was free. Without thinking I launched myself through the study window and out in the world.</p>
	<p>I hid in the basement of a famous bakery so busy I was never noticed. There I put all my theories to paper and soon under a pseudonym was famous. My books joined the nightstands of captains crossing the world, royalty and democratic leaders alike; the most academic of academics, everyone who had a curiosity of this world had also a curiosity for the contents of my book.</p>
	<p>Yet always alone I remained. I could not interact with other psychologists, with the academics who wanted to discuss the work. I new only to bite my lip until blood drove them away. It did. In turn, it drove me further into seclusion until I escaped through theatre. I learned to assemble a character, the character talking to you now, out of the pieces of many people I had listened to and studied throughout my many hours of silence. I am starring in a reality play here now and everyday of my melancholic life. I am the sum of all who I chose to mimic yet only a fragment of each. Please, for now on call me Samekh for I am now of many related ripples."</p>
	<p>“Samekh, true your life was difficult, but abandon the self-pity and begin living a life for something else, and not a life meant to compensate for dismal beginning. You have success now. Have your intellect’s conversations, and leave me to my tree.” 
“Fine I must be going then. I have more appreciative clients to help.” Dr. Samekh packed his leather satchel, climbed onto his bike and rode off.</p>
	<p>Peace for a moment.</p>
	<p>A high-pitched whistle of aural irritation sounded closer; the sound waves compressed tighter. The pain from its perception clenched the teeth and winced the eyes. The contrast to purposeful patterns and logic ached my ears, sensitive and attuned to only beauty. All one wanted was relief.</p>
	<p>This was Dante the boy of the devil with his whistle of public torture.</p>
	<p>"Are you ready to get out of that maggot hole, pop? Done with your pious act to amend your prior disgraceful life? No more risk of lighting bolts and hell fire from above. Oh, ow, it burns! Ah how shocking the lack of heavenly shock,” Dante laughed with himself and pretended to burn.</p>
	<p>"I told you not to come here unless you had a change of heart and black to red would need more than an alchemist to fix, so you cannot possibly be here for that. Please go back home. I need to eat and wish for no more guests, regretfully of my blood or not."
"Father you grow more distant each day. Your mind moves more distant from sanity as fast as a three-sailed ship from shore. Mikhail said you show signs of a certain poisoning from ergot and all that vile bread you eat., I think its Alzheimer's ready to melt your brain dead."</p>
	<p>"Oh, I applaud your tact Dante," I began with a sardonic smile, "it is not Alzheimer's rather wisdom. Mikhail is wrong. His mind is trapped in a capitalistic conception of organization for society. I operate in parallel with the clarity of a blank slate, and the density of an open source encyclopedia. I see that the meaning of life is not a game of acquisition meant to broaden an ego so far it stretches past the grave into subsequent generations. Rather life is a singularity event. We are birthed alone and die alone. So we must in an existential manner define all that falls between both ends of the continuum of eternal continuance in the name of the one who has bequeathed us this earth." I had diverged, changed tracks, become lost in philosophical speculation. I continued my speech but am unable to relate anymore of it.</p>
	<p>A snore so exaggerated it lost its humor pierced my rambling.</p>
	<p>I stopped.</p>
	<p>Dante spoke, "So this painting, where is it?"</p>
	<p>"Painting?"</p>
	<p>"The Bosch painting of yours that you lost. You said you had a clue, where it may be found."</p>
	<p>I must have mentioned it in my reverie. "Oh the Bosch, that piece I so coveted and fought to acquire, to own. Its consumption was so tasteful, and I think it should be left alone, wherever it may be." </p>
	<p>"You gave away all our wealth. I need this painting. I need to sell it. We are penniless.”</p>
	<p>“You are not penniless. I made all arrangements to have you cared for by the monastery. They will provide all you need, and nothing you should want.”</p>
	<p>“I do not want to be an orphan in care of some strange monks. After ruining our childhood, you could at least-“</p>
	<p>“You need a slap to your senses. Leave me here, alone!”</p>
	<p>Dante’s face transformed into his mother’s, my beloved wife’s, yet not the pleasant lively face of a woman in her prime. No a sick lifeless and pale form.</p>
	<p>“You killed your mother but I still loved you. I gave you everything, but neither her gross sacrifice nor mine is good enough for you. Leave, leave and never show your sordid soul here again!”</p>
	<p>Carnal emotion transpired on both sides. Unable to intellectually overcome the emotional death shot of his father, Dante, collapsed into salty-tears against the tree.</p>
	<p>“Dante.”</p>
	<p>“Dante please let me apologize. I am not I. I do not know what possesses me at the moment."</p>
	<p>I ripped some bread and scraped it along my makeshift wooden plate. The apricot spread clung to the yellow-green bread then continued."</p>
	<p>“But really I know nothing about the Bosch, so cannot reveal its location any easier than you can."</p>
	<p>"The painting is all you mentioned and talked about the last time we picked you up off the street down near the docks. You called it your favorite but lost son.”</p>
	<p>"I have no recollection of the location of the supposed lost Bosch painting. I have collected many paintings and cannot be expected to track the location of all of them. Can you leave me to my bread?"</p>
	<p>"Your poison? As you wish" Dante sat in frustration against the tree. He carved his initials unwilling to give up, but uncertain how to continue.</p>
	<p>I became again lost with my mind wrapped in on itself. I remained so until a sweet sound so unlike Dante yet in someway similar awoke me. An irritation on my side itched and burned.</p>
	<p>"Gabriel?" asked I with fragile awareness of the question.</p>
	<p>"Yes, your eldest son of a few minutes. I have come on request of Dante to bid you to please inform us, or at least I, further about this painting."</p>
	<p>"I am sorry but I know nothing."</p>
	<p>"You do but withhold it."</p>
	<p>"No, Gabriel, never could I do that to you, not not you, mein Engel."</p>
	<p>"And me father, what am I to you?" asked Dante with a sense of prescience.</p>
	<p>"No I already know. You loathe me. You consider me a nuisance. That which you had to suffer to have Gabriel. The balance of good and evil. A part of the balance of life and a necessity under the rules of this realm. Tell him to eat more bread Gabriel. Tell him to eat his poison and reveal to us his clue before he dies, if he would only be so kind. Through 17 years I accepted my father as an opaque apparition through the light-bends of a thick glass bottle. But no more. I am soon 18 with all my inheritance ashes. Ashes because of his own trust in an illusion.”</p>
	<p>As Dante spoke, the emotion erupted from deep within, and passed a point of no return. Dante entered frenzy; he tore at where I end and he begins. He shredded his fingers as he shredded the bark. He ripped the root up and entered my tree. He scurried this way, then that way. The alterations are immediate and his actions herald chaos. One might define his actions as a fury or a whirl. The energy battered my flesh with the ease of the accidental tapping of an electrical socket. Resistance broke in an instant and only the effects of its power evident. Weak from a sedentary lifestyle, he overpowered me with ease.</p>
	<p>"Eat. And then think clear you old man." He shoved the bread into my mouth. The broken opening let more light in. I saw the ergot clearer than ever before.</p>
	<p>Gabriel screamed in horror. He pulls Dante off pins him onto the ground effortlessly. Satisfied with the feeding, Dante surrenders without further fight.</p>
	<p>I murmur inaudibly. The shock of sudden stress has driven my addled mind into a disconnected state. My eyes close and open and in the dirt I scratch a word. I am prone babbling scratching and drooling. Tremors punctuate my murmurs.
Gabriel looks on in horror and bewilderment.</p>
	<p>Dante smirks and creeps closer.</p>
	<p>"Now that is what I want you old drunk. Scratch it out so I never have to return and feel compelled to pity again."</p>
	<p>I scratched out the name of painting. </p>
	<p>Dante reined his rage and studied the scratching, then wiped before Gabriel could read it.</p>
	<p><em>The Temptation of St Anthony</em> said my ill and runic script.</p>
	<p>At once Dante escaped the tree while Gabriel kneeled and coddled me, his elder succumbed to being his minor. </p>
	<p>I woke in Gabriel's arms. He was asleep. Moonlight shone through the fist hole of my door. Gabriel awoke with slow eyes, hesitant before the world.</p>
	<p>"Gab…Gabriel"</p>
	<p>"Yes, Father."</p>
	<p>"I am sorry. I remember the evening like one remembers a nightmare."</p>
	<p>"It is better that way. Do you remember the painting?"</p>
	<p>“Painting? Yes I remember it. What did you need to know?”</p>
	<p>“I need the name. You scratched out the name of the painting in the mud, but Dante erased it.”</p>
	<p>"I can only remember that I desperately need that painting Gabriel, please find it. Help your brother and leave me to my tree.”</p>
	<p>"No, Father, you will not stay here. You will come with me back home, and end this charade."</p>
	<p>"I cannot. You have not yet guessed my act."</p>
	<p>"What is your act?"</p>
	<p>"I do not know.</p>
	<p>"I am trying to help, not decode a puzzle."</p>
	<p>"But that is it Gabriel! I am decoding a puzzle. My last years are an uncharted, unexplored self-aware puzzle. I need help solving it. That painting must mean something. I plead you to aid your brother in a search."</p>
	<p>"Like the woman meant something? You must leave this tree and get some help.”</p>
	<p>“Help, yes help your brother.”</p>
	<p>“No you need help.”</p>
	<p>“Yes, yes I do. I need that painting. I need help decoding this puzzle and that painting is surely the first step. Will you help me? Will you help your brother?”</p>
	<p>“No I don’t see how I can. Dante hates me, almost equal as he hates you.”</p>
	<p>"You must overcome that and join him."</p>
	<p>"No. I just cannot. If I search, I will search alone. If this will help and get you out this tree then I will do it. I must go."</p>
	<p>"Gabriel you were always the better son, but Dante is an untamed soul. Be careful.”</p>
	<p>“No more bread,” replied Gabriel as he departed.</p>
	<p>Ease fell upon me as my brain nestled into a return to sleep. The seizures came now disguised as dreams. The ergot and the cancers weakened me everyday. I needed to find strength.</p>
