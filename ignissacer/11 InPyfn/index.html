	<div class="content">
<p>
    Dante struggled through the thick brush at the forests entrance. The air was refreshing. He forgot its vitality.
</p>
<p>
    At Pfyn’s entrance, the dwarfish arborescent grove of bergföhre trees set upon and strangled the littered boulders. Past the boulders, where Dante now
    trekked in twilight, bunched columns of overgrown Fichte and Tanne like a quiver of a thousand arrows. Their tips reached forty meters.
</p>
<p>
    He took careful steps in endearing disbelief. Dante treaded Flotador, a land of water plants so dense and entangled they allow boots to make an
    imperceptible impression into the large swampy lake. The only living creatures in this part of the forest were serpent-like <em>schwimmer</em>, a water-loving snake
    that squeeze their cell-width thin bodies through the narrowest of crevices. Every step Dante prepared for a desperate swim, but never fell in. He ran. He
    jumped. Never more than a few pictometers deep did the plants allow his depression. His disbelief faded into expectance.
</p>
<p>
    The land of water and plant was flat, calm, and enchanted for its qualities promoted fantastical thoughts that preyed upon well-developed imaginations. The
    land was far more magical than magical describes and far more enchanted than any tale of a brother Grimm for this land was sourced from dreams of Dante’s,
    a near limitless canvas bounded only by conceptual extents of a 3-D entrenched, teenage mind.
</p>
<p>
    The compact fichte and tanne tightly wound at the top pushed out all light, all of the visible electromagnetic radiation the brain processed into color,
    into sight—that neural invention. Eternal shadows expelled all life but the <em>schwimmer</em>; a dearth of life meant silence.
</p>
<p>
    Dante felt nothing, heard nothing and smelled nothing; the dense but invisible air arrested all smells and sounds. Even a scream from mouth to ear never
    completed its journey. As a result, the void of sensory information tricked his novice pons—a gatekeeper brain stem region responsible for maintaining
    respiration and relaying all sensory activity—into the electrical processing of sleep. In sleep, the pons relays sensory information, although there is
    only random electrical noise to "sense." The information is confounding, nonsense; creative to a fault. Yet it pulses through and mixes with memories from
    the hippocampus.
</p>
<p>
    This is a part of the complex conversations of the nightly memory sort in sleep. The higher regions of the brain in the neocortex, desperate to see a
    pattern in the mix of sensory noise and memories, attempt to construct them into a cohesive story. So, the cute girl at the checkout becomes a passenger on
    a decades past drive to the beach, which turns out to be the grocery store morphing into school and at this point the girl vanishes as the dreams’ whims
    turns like a fire log from solid wood to wisps of wood smoke; their plausibility so fragile and meandering that the events are vanishing before ever
    becoming substantial.
</p>
<p>
    Dante's mind abhorring vacancy resonated with this chaos of self-generated noise. As in dreaming, the waking conscious mind of Dante drifted through lucid
    retellings of the day. The memories mixed with the indiscriminate sensory information from the pons, thus clogging the conscience with input—the ale of
    brains brew in dreams.
</p>
<p>
    A satellite passing above Flotador would see nothing; it has no dreams. Flotador emerged as a unique creation of Dante’s mind, fabricating all that filled
    his reality beyond the fabric of plants and water.
</p>
<p>
    To the right a figure of a vicious dog lurks—it is a nightmare on the hunt. Dante does not see it, not immediately. Recognition comes slowly as attention
    to one stream among thousands, as the focus on a single brush stroke upon a masterpiece.
</p>
<p>
    The figure lurks but instinct drives it into stalking and then pursuit.
</p>
<p>
    Dante turns and sees it. He runs. The nightmare runs. His dreams develop a sense of urgency. The wide flat surface of Flotador grows peripheral edges and
    narrows.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare dashes out from the parallel pursuit and settles into a steady chase.
</p>
<p>
    The surface becomes less flat, more obscured.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare gains.
</p>
<p>
    Dusk sets in or a dusk of memories past.
</p>
<p>
    The pons—an elementary brain region–cannot tell reality from dream. It raises respiration and his eyes blink fast. Open. Closed. Op-clo-en-sed.
</p>
<p>
    This is Rapid Eye Movement sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s toes curl in, trying to grab the ground through his boots.
</p>
<p>
    The world becomes fantastical as dreams flood conscience to fend off nightmare.
</p>
<p>
    For a few seconds nightmare is obscured by a kinetic wave of memories.
</p>
<p>
    His father.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest.
</p>
<p>
    His dog Pushkin.
</p>
<p>
    His childhood room.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest.
</p>
<p>
    His mother. Her schockolade eyes. Her fair skin. Her locks of dripping caramel.
</p>
<p>
    The waves of images are connected like frames of film.
</p>
<p>
    A single frame of the nightmare seeps in.
</p>
<p>
    He sees the banality of days past. He sees the poor he could not consciously place seeing. His non-conscious memory had spilled into his conscious. He was
    running now, not in a race but driven by the propulsion of his beating heart throwing him forwards with every beat.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest?
</p>
<p>
    The conscious experience of the chaotic dreams cuts before he can consider it.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel takes his first slash at the forest bred bark and tree. He follows the nomads. Behind him the trees immediately thicken and the dense brush at the
    forests end strengthens. As twins, their dreams were complimentary, and so as twins, were Gabriel and Dante but a few who could complete such a quest in
    company, and not alone.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare is a diamond-encrusted wolf’s silhouette. The teeth gleam with the gluttony of pointed engagement rings.
</p>
<p>
    Dante glances back and glimpses his gleaming fate.
</p>
<p>
    Narrows of the forest narrow. His shoulders will be pinched before nightmare comes.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare nips his heel.
</p>
<p>
    A frame of his mother lying in a bed covered in red. She looks frail, lifeless and gaunt.
</p>
<p>
    Images Dante had never seen.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare nips again.
</p>
<p>
    His mother is agonizing. Doctors surround her. At the end of the bed her feet twitch and push into the mattress as Dante's pushes his feet harder into the
    ground.
</p>
<p>
    The diamonds shred his pants and nick his calf.
</p>
<p>
    A frame of his mother appears with gray eyes, gray skin, all the life filtered out.
</p>
<p>
    His breath comes with desperate suction. Each one a gift.
</p>
<p>
    His side is filled with needles. He cannot outrun it.
</p>
<p>
    The forest narrows enclose.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare’s diamonds scratch his leg.
</p>
<p>
    He kicks his battered leg back in fearful defense.
</p>
<p>
    A funeral for his mother. His father is absent. Then more images flood and flood as his heart pumps life out of his leg. Nightmare nips and bites and
    scratches.
</p>
<p>
    The images excite him, torture him, and he cannot place them. Has he never seen them?
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare leaps, mouth open.
</p>
<p>
    The narrows brush his shoulders then pinch them.
</p>
<p>
    He slows.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare eviscerates Dante through the back, through the gut.
</p>
<p>
    The forest narrows crush him shoulder to shoulder. Snaps sound.
</p>
<p>
    White light flashes. Overexcitement perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    All that stands are Beech trees.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel moves forward with deliberate measured steps weary of a forest that closes out his entrance. The light disappears. He digs into his sack for his
    candle. Night has come so soon this evening. He lights the candle and raises it. The canopy above is dense but the floor beneath by the bases of the grand
    trees is sparse. Few living things can survive the purging of light.. Gabriel continues walking until he meets a stream of water black to his darkened eyes
    but blue and refreshing to his candle's light. The blue puddle draws Gabriel to its surface. He blows out the candle and bends low to the water. He cups his
    hand and scoops the water to his mouth. He did not realize how thirsty he had been and shovels scoopful after scoopful of water into his dry mouth. He
    splashes his face, wipes it mostly dry with his sleeve and then stands back up. He reaches for his candle but hesitates.
</p>
<p>
    Lights appear in the distance.
</p>
<p>
    Have his dreams already begun? It cannot be. He still senses the cold of the water.
</p>
<p>
    He flicks a match and lights his candle. The distant lights become closer, and closer, approaching Gabriel with haste.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel blows out the candle and stuffs it into his sack as he creeps along the stream to a narrow turn and leaps across, towards the lights. He crouches
    down behind a fallen giant of the forest, now alive with a life-passed. The lights are almost upon him. “Who could have lights in this deserted forest?” he
    wonders. He never knew any humans to live here. The only life he knew of were <em>weisswölfe</em>—a large white wolf known for its brilliant coats and elusiveness.
    They were harmless unless provoked, but finding one to provoke was a difficult task. He had never seen one and still had a doubt of their existence. They
    were probably another story of his Father’s to impede adventure, though there was a far more dangerous force in this forest than the <em>weisswölfe</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Light—diffused across the stream—showed a distortion of a man. The unsteady water bent the light creating a monster. Gabriel stopped breathing. He pressed
    his back into tree and lowered his end. The lights moved forward and a large orange boot came down over the log. Then another boot fell. They belonged to a
    villager, who was dressed as a hiker but had three extra arms each protruding with a bright lamp at its tip. His coverings were a patchwork of amateur
    tailoring fashioned from burlap and stained with the organic flavor of the forest. All the villager wore had a thin layer of ingrained dirt. The villager
    was covered, even his face in cloth and burlap. On his back he worse a burlap sack painted in yellow-reds to excite and disturb the goal of his hunts. His
    pants were an indiscriminate hide, beige from sun and forest. His coat was a bright white, a beacon of destruction and despair. He wore the skin of a
    <em>weisswölfe</em>. Heads of steeds, of sheep, or all manner of animal adorned his cloth and from these many heads emerged an image of an allegorical Giuseppe
    Arcimboldo painting, disturbing but surreal.

		</div>
<p>
    The light arms coiled robotic, and moved with a fluid slither through the air like three silver cobras dancing to the up and downs, the push and pulls of a
    charmer’s flute. Solar panels adorned the battery pack and yet still harkened a time of great exploration. The trilight suit, familiar to Gabriel, was the
    uniform of supposed <em>weisswölfe</em> poachers. Although, this rudimentary version appeared to have risen from the junk pile of two overzealous amateurs after
    some quick money.
</p>
<p>
    Expert Poachers never left their vehicles to go on foot. Instead they drove through the forest in their stealthy armored vehicles and shot the wolves from
    behind small slits in the armor that protected their luxury seating and entitled faces. The wolves though harmless were rendered menaces and beasts by the
    propaganda of the environmentally negligent and money-focused interests of the poachers. The impetuous savages lusted only for the brilliant white coats
    whose rarity demanded high prices. Their practices though unsustainable bothered not their uneducated minds, only focused meeting their present suspect
    “needs.” Needs to support themselves or the ever-pathetic excuse of supporting family, but a family they created and therein have revealed only themselves
    as the true cause of their problems.
</p>
<p>
    His coils bent and searched. They purged the darkness as he splashed through the stream. Contaminated yellow light, the tint of ergot, infected the land
    with each flex of coil.
</p>
<p>
    He had a lure on his backpack consisting of a toxic fake rabbit connected to large rope, which was a common tool of the <em>weisswölfe</em> poacher. The poachers
    set these out for the wolves, who eagerly pounced and crushed the rabbit in their jaws. The wolf’s teeth punctured the fragile shell of the toxic pouch
    stuffed into the rabbit. Toxins locked the jaw and caused momentary paralysis, just enough time for two-handed axe to fall on the defenseless wolf’s neck.
    But this was the primitive way, the dangerous way done by amateurs now. The toxin was no longer produced and amateurs lent themselves to being amateur
    chemists as well, with a risk that the toxin would fail, or have adverse effects. And an angered <em>weisswölfe</em> sees no end to its fury without bloodshed. This
    particular amateur had a bloodied axe on his back, and all four limbs.
</p>
<p>
    “Yelp!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was startled and yelped too. His position was compromised but he stayed frozen.
</p>
<p>
    The lights jolted backwards searching. They missed Gabriel. Then they turned back. The poacher stood on the streams edge and yelled into his arms.
</p>
<p>
    “That is it. This beast isn’t worth the scare. I ain’t havin’ no mamma wolf on my tail efter ‘er baby.”
</p>
<p>
    He turns and Gabriel sees the poacher with a small <em>weisswölfechen</em> in his arms and at this rate perhaps one of the last one to be born of the once pervasive
    population.
</p>
<p>
    The poacher holds a knife up to the wolf’s throat.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel gasps, “No!”
</p>
<p>
    The poacher turned around searching for the gasp and called out, “Who is there? Come out!”
</p>
<p>
    The lights showed Gabriel. He tried to block the most intense beams with a flat hand and squinting eyes. A small white <em>weisswölfechen</em> squirmed in the
    poachers’ arms.
</p>
<p>
    “Stand up, boy!”
</p>
<p>
    “I am no boy!” Gabriel stood up as tall as he could manage.
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing in this forest, all alone?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not alone. I’m with my father.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh sure, sure, your father. And where is he?”
</p>
<p>
    “He's, uh, gathering some sticks for firewood out that way” and he pointed downstream.
</p>
<p>
    “Well then what are you and your father doing in the forest? In my territory? I worked out a deal with the other hunters and not a soul should be here.”
</p>
<p>
    “Were passing through, too poor to pay for security along the rubbish road. Please do not hurt that puppy.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will do with my wolves what I want, and have no qualms cutting this little ones neck for calling the whole pack upon me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Perhaps its only hungry. I will take it from you,” pleaded Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “No I cannot risk it. It has my scent now and will bring its whole pack on me if I'm ever within spitting distance of this forest again. I think it’a’be
    best if I kill it, and then I kill, you,” the pointed end of a gnarly knife confirmed the threat.
</p>
<p>
    “So, you killed its mother?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, Sir, I did and she was quite a beauty. She’ll fetch me my biggest prize yet.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s disgusting. What you do disgusts me. These wolves should be preserved and respected not hunted for their coats with everything else going to
    waste.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, I’ve a family to feed, something ya know nuthin bout.”
</p>
<p>
    “That only illuminates irresponsibility. You were not forced to have family, thus they are no burden of anyone or any state, only your burden. And what do
    you plan to do when all the wolves are gone? Let your family starve and think even less of you?”
</p>
<p>
    “I will not take such disrespect from a boy. You come over here now so I can give you a slap like your father should have done when you was a kid.”
</p>
<p>
    “Your blood-stained hands will never touch me.”
</p>
<p>
    As Gabriel spoke the last few syllables, he launched out of the brush, pulled out his dagger and aimed the blunt handle at the poacher’s forehead— the
    sturdy butt of the dagger knocked the poacher out. Gabriel found violence so primitive. He excelled in its effective application but struggled with the
    dissonance of that fact congruent with his utter hate of the propensity of the dumb to engage it on impulse. Like these poachers, who act as survival
    automata, which view all other animals and people as exploitable barriers.
</p>
<p>
    He scooped up the puppy using his shirt careful to avoid spreading his scent, gave it some sausage from his bag and set it free across the stream. He left
    the poacher to seek penance from the wolves.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel tore off the poachers white coat to wear in honor of the wolf whose life now only meant this coat. Before he put it on, he dragged it through the
    mud and soaked to offset the bright white, an attractant for a vengeful pack.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel opened his bag and pulled out the sheep’s bladder of mulled wine. The spicy alcohol tingled his cheeks, tongue and throat then down into the
    stomach and throughout his entire body. He took out his mat made of swan feathers stuffed into a whale’s stomach, and unrolled it. The swan feathers were a
    soft island on the hard ground; the whale’s stomach ensured they were dry. He stretched out across the mat and shut his eyes. The old mulled wine was an
    anesthetic and he fell a deep slumber full of vivid dreams and no nightmares. Gabriel transitioned in a wine-inspired sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s sleep lasted a day or maybe a decade. Without any light or stars he could only guess. He felt rested and ready, not overslept or underslept and
    made to a quick start to his day. He switched the battery pack on and the lights came to a reluctant luminescence. The battery was low. He began with a
    steady jog. The lights would not endure another lightless day, so he must hurry. His candle would get him only a few hours and then he would accede to the
    whims of the darkness.
</p>
<p>
    A few hours passed and Gabriel again tired under the weight of the battery. The lights had already begun to dim without enough voltage to produce a
    substantial light. Gabriel switched the lights off and took the battery pack off. He pulled some coffee beans out of his bag. They crunched with a bite and
    splintered into every crevice of his teeth. The gritty beans would give him the motivation to catch up to Dante. He could not be much farther now.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stared into the abyss of black. Absence of light had a solemn tone, and unsettled one as the unknown unsettles, but also relaxed as the calm of
    emptiness can. He pondered if Nietzsche’s abyss was looking back at him. Were there poachers’ eyes on him in his masquerade? He had the battery pack but no
    other marks. An unsettling feeling began to overcome any calm, betrayed by his own rumination.
</p>
<p>
    He switched on the battery pack. No light. He switched it off and on. Again no light.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled out his candle. The dripping wax and fragile flame slowed him down. He hoped to yet intercept Dante.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel entered a slow jog. The candle flame struggled against the passing wind, and lit only a narrow patch ahead of him. The coffee beans lent him the
    adrenaline to be purposeful and attentive. His eyes had completely adjusted to their new lifestyle of discerning vibrating blurs of black and white.
</p>
<p>
    The candle, worthless in facing the winds of the abyss, extinguished. Gabriel now must travel the vast expanse in dark with great threat to his mind by his
    mind. The terrain declined in a slight grade down into the Stillfluss, an offshoot of the Rhein that meandered capriciously through the forest. Through the
    dark forest slithered a force of water with a breadth unparalleled and a depth holding some of the deepest biological secrets. Rumors, legends, and
    scientific hypotheses have been made about the origin and demeanor of creatures nestled beneath its depths. A peasant and a scientists alike would tell you
    fantastic stories of tree-sized fish without eyes. In place of sight, they play haunting sonar of drones and unnerving pitches to see with sound. Or the
    so-called Lucifer Lizard, which breathes microwaves that boil its prey with ease.
</p>
<p>
    Miles yet lay between Gabriel and the stream. He had been in a decline for a half-hour now. Gabriel worried Dante had tried to cross the Stillfluss without
    the help of a ferry tortoise. Another creature of the river very much confirmed to exist. The tortoises were as large as man, and some say as intelligent.
    They did now have the modern amenities one equated with an advanced society but material is subject to morality and the tortoise lived in a society of
    sharing, of ubiquitous peace, of utopia despite their unclothed shells and mud homes.
</p>
<p>
    A foot caught an unconscious body and Gabriel had found Dante. He fell forward, gravity yanking him down the steady slope into a confused roll.
</p>
<p>
    Lights!
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was blinded. The sudden flash had overwhelmed his rods and they shut-off in protest.
</p>
<p>
    His hearing, still acute from hours of visual deficiency, alerted him. More poachers were here and now pinched him from both sides.
</p>
<p>
    “I am no wolf my lords!” shouted Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, did ya hear that Peir. We’re lords now.”
</p>
<p>
    “I did hear and I say we punish this intruder as a lord would.”
</p>
<p>
    “Punish me for intrusion? But I am only a misguided peasant who means no dishonor to your lands.”
</p>
<p>
    “Cut his tongue out! Cut the bastard’s tongue out of that lyin’ mouth! No peasant dare enter these forests. You are intruding not only on our land but our
    livelihoods. You run like a train rumbling through our forest! Not a single wolf ll’be miles o’here. If yer travelin’, ye should be on the rubbish road!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel smirked reluctantly. He seemed on a path to violence only an animal was capable of. After all, he had evolved during a foraging lifestyle not far
    departed from the life of an animal.
</p>
<p>
    “Yelp” a sorry cry came from behind Gabriel. The orphaned <em>weisswölfechen</em> had followed Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “What was that? You have a pup in there. Are you trying to get everyone killed?”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, I killed its mother and have taken this a prize. I. . .I can pay. I have not much, but will trade all I have for my freedom and direction
    from your lands.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t want a peasants pennies!”
</p>

    “Peir if he can pay, let him pay,” said the poacher under the dimmer light and with a whisper added, “we can take his meager life anyways. I reckon my boot
    would be enough.”
</p>
<p>
    His whisper was a yell to Gabriel’s overly sensitive ears.
</p>
<p>
    “How much ya got peasant?” blurted the brighter light.
</p>
<p>
    “I have 1 Geld and some 1/10 pieces”
</p>
<p>
    “1 Geld will save your foot”
</p>
<p>
    “Its all the metal I have in this world. I am banished from my home and now wander to a new home.”
</p>
<p>
    The brighter light approached him.
</p>
<p>
    “Hand it over!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel bent over and foraged in his pocket. The acting was a sufficient ruse to distract the poacher from his other hand now grasping his dagger. “He
    thrust the dagger into the bright light and heard it make its mark. At the same time, an elegance of glistening white, so powerful yet with majesty unfit
    of these backwoods poachers burst from the darkness and eviscerated the dimmer of the lights. The growls, and tearing of flesh that comprised violence were
    expected of this animal, having no higher functioning. The screams behind the dimmer light became muted by the flow of blood into the throat, which lay
    frayed and torn. The glistening <em>weisswölfe</em> vanished into the black. Gabriel, frozen in awe, could not even offer the <em>weisswölfe</em> a silent nod of
    appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel resourced the Poachers’ lights: one he wore and one he packed for Dante. Gabriel looked at his first kill, so different than the dummies in his
    father’s courtyard. The blood was liquid not straw and the smell already much worse than even a long day’s practice in the humid sunny air. He had taken
    life and a life deserving of no memorial than what rots here, and had no regrets for using the less blunt end of his dagger.
</p>
<p>
    He found the many variety of lives intriguing. His father had a life worthy of immortality in memorial, but others are hardly as lucky or some even more
    so. Some are given meaning that even a school child can recite, while others are never even given a life that allows them any idea of what life is. Birthed
    and then dead before a brain could grow to comprehend or remember that they existed. They breathed. They had heartbeats. They did not live.
