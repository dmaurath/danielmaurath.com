				<p>			
				A wealthy but terminally-ill psychologist becomes a hermit due to ergot poisoning in a quasi-European not quite modern, not quite passed time. In his 						hermit's tree, he is often visited by his Faustian sons, a mosaic of a man, and his mentee, the mayor. 			</p>
				<p> 
				This is the story of the final weeks leading up to his death hinged on the discovery of a cherished painting: <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em> by 					Hieronymus Bosch.

		<h2 id="prologue"> 1. Prologue </h2>
			<div id="prologue_content" style="display:none">
		<p>
		    Smoke of a dense central furnace disintegrating into a diaphanous periphery flowed up in a slow sway of frigid final breath.
		</p>
		<p>
		    With the fall of a hammer I was free. Free of the constant burden of respiration. Free of the irrational fear of death. Free of my last possession, the
		    final artifact of my consumerism: Hieronymus Bosch’s <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>—an exquisite priceless piece that is a surreal evocation of the
		    ever inspirational theme of St. Anthony’s temptations in the desert. Anthony, who resisted temptress phantoms and Demons manifested as spurious offers of
		    wealth and violent tormenters that infiltrated his every waking moment, is appealed to now for deliverance from an infectious disease of the skin named in
		    his direct honor, <em>St Anthony’s Fire</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
		    St. Anthony’s fire is caused by ergot fungus in spoiled rye. Symptoms include: seizures, spasms diarrhea, parenthesis, itching, headaches, nausea,
		    vomiting, and gangrene that emerges at the fingertips and toe tips then spreads until at once the dead, black tissue meets as one, united.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Athanasius of Alexandria put all the stories of St Anthony to paper in an influential biography <em>Vita S Antoni</em>. The spread of St Anthony’s life’s
		    stories and the ideas they withheld led to the rise of monasticism across the west. This is the story of all that precedes the hammer fall. Like
		    consciousness, it is a confluence of thoughts and ideas, of both natural and human artistic expressions, concise but dense with mind-wandering nutrients,
		    which I can only hope precipitates a fraction of <em>Vita S Antoni</em>’s influence.

			<div id="volatile_content" style="display:none">
				<p>	"Dante, you devilish boy, unroll that dog this minute!" commanded Ms. Steinhurst.</p>
				<p>	"You object as if you are his counsel. But it is obvious he is asleep and seeks none!”</p>
				<p>"Ah, but if that blanket-wrapped sausage wakes and takes your nose to be a sausage, will you not seek counsel?"</p>
				<p>	"Fine, fine, only a bit of fun with old Pushkin"</p>
				<p>"Old indeed! More respect for your Elders is a point in which you must work on. Where is your brother, Gabriel?"</p>
				<p>"Off on his knees babbling on about Mother, no doubt"</p>
				<p>"How dare you insult your late Mother!"</p>
				<p>"I am sorry, Madam, but he never plays and I am forever bored without another playmate"</p>
				<p>"Go, go join him, be in company with him for the day, and then you will not be bored nor so black-tongued."</p>
				<p>“But Madam my tongue is pink, or is the well so facetious as to deceive me?”</p>
				<p>“The well does not deceive you. The tongue is black in metaphor. The things you say are dark and as your tongue is the principal facilitator of speech, it must also be dark. Now, do as I say and join your brother.”</p>
				<p>	“Yes, Madam”</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>I, a distinguished but self-absorbed professor of psychological physics, entered this exchange unprepared, my capable mind burdened with internal ideas uninterested in the external. </p>
				<p>“What would you like for dinner doctor?” asked Ms. Steinhurst.</p>
				<p>After a long moment’s hesitation, I replied, “No, no dinner, I ate too much bread at lunch.”</p>
				<p>I made my way from the foyer to relaxation in my study, cigar alit and wine in hand. In residence was a 19th century globe, an ornate chandelier, generous glass bar, large leather chairs, well-placed antique lamps upon antique end tables, paintings of social import, a mammoth antique Ferghan rug atop the centuries old cherry wood floor—it was quite a demonstration of wealth, of success one might say. I sat in my favorite chair, which was well worn from years of erosion by my backside. I relaxed there and considered my Faustian sons who seemed to be my personal genetic representation of a holy war: one devilish and one angelic.  They were yet innocent boys, and in this stage of the story no more evil or angelic than normal. But they were very much on opposite ends of the continuum, bookended by utmost evil and utmost good, left to right or right to left is inconsequent, decide your alignment for the world itself is indecisive. On to musings my mind thrust and the pen followed.</p>
				<div class = "indent">
				<p><em>Patterns govern our existence. Patterns of neurons contrive a vile existence of an ever present “us versus them.” Infants, at three months, see race; it is how they are wired, how the neurons are patterned. The infants grow into adults of frightful affiliation to others of strong but also tenuous connection. From an infantile reflex arises this pattern of connections in an equally infantile goal of defending even spurious relations. A mere perception of relatedness allows us to risk our lives in the name of our brothers or motherland, those bastards of relation in name alone, which reason rejects. Call us a fraternity and we shall die for it. That is a reflex. Automatic. Without thought. </em></p>
				<p><em>Yet I still cry at the cruelty of the beauty of  this us versus them world that I am fit only a few decades for. I aim to perceive everyday in a fuller way: like a shattered mirror reflects light in infinite variety. So, too, do I want to perceive life in infinite variety. To this will is my conscious subservient. To this conscious, wills my will a new portrait of life.  To this will I venture to shatter my life into pieces, to form that new portrait: a mosaic.</em></p>
				<p><em>This will be it named I will not name To name it, would be to arrogate that I could hold such a position.  Instead a description suffices. The will is my contention of my place in an allegorical cave  imprisoned in a society of prisoners who are excluded to mere shadows of existence. I do not have the luxury of free movement like the philosopher, unrestrained by the physical realities of the world. Rather I am imprisoned by the laws of nature, of friction and pressure, of gravity and tension. I am a prisoner not turned towards mere shadows, but towards the source of the shadows. The source is our psychology; the shadows are all that we experience.. The shadows are irrational emotions and insufficient thinking, and the prisoners hold them as complete truth.  Knowledge of the external is valued but knowledge of the internal is not. There is no bible for the brain. The collective psychologists and I are writing it. </em></p>
				<p><em>I contend that I as a psychologist am requisite to explain to the entire myriad malfunctions undesired by a rational mind. Cognitive and motivational biases number in the hundreds but few are trained in their recognition. Few can rein in irrational emotion. Few can withhold the impulse to hurt others both physically and materialistically instead of solving the underlying causes. Man goes through the motions of life without ever understanding the basis of life. Man tries. Man ascribes supernatural origins for cognitive processes and even names these origins under an only humanistic ideal of omniscience. And this naming gives rise to conflict between prisoners, for one name must be better than another name. An insult of a name is an insult of the believer, of what they arranged their lives around, of their intelligence, so an insult must be eliminated lest their existence fall to pieces.  I intervene to describe the true source of the shadows but fall victim myself to impulse. I can only educate as much as they listen. </em></p>
				<p><em>Thus, I seek to transcend burdened ways, and live a life unattached to this world of prisoners. To be free I must relinquish all ties to this world. For they are just that, ties, prison restraints that do not allow me to think with my mind completely open and will never let me leave in the fashion that I must.  I must not turn my mind inward and east into a fortress against all that touches skin. I must turn my mind inward and outward and respect the ideas of the future and meditations of the past. </em></p>
				<p><em> I do not consider the eternal cycle to be the Der Sinn des Lebens rather I consider Der Sinn des Lebens ist sterben. Death defines life and definition is meaning. Death is the one source of all pain.  All fear is a derivative of death. All happiness is to laugh at death. All sadness is to remember death. All motivation is to succeed before death. All despair is in the face of death. It reigns as the pinnacle punishment and pinnacle right of immortal honor. Death is not to be sought. If so, all this writing has been fruitless. Rather a life is and must be experienced with death. And this experience is stressful. It is horrible. It is a tearing and clawing experience. It is life. The threat of death grasps the gut. The threat is eternal as I am not. The threat can only be temporarily ignored.  So we must commit to this Drange, to a greater feeling of relief from burden, than any neurochemical reaction our genetics could indirectly create as dopamine released, than any religious order or spirituality has achieved. We must acknowledge that the meaning of life is death, and if it’s purpose you seek, then you seek it all your life, and your purpose becomes all that approached death-</em></p>

				<p>I fell into convulsions, fell out of the chair, fell into a coma as my brain ventured to assess the damage, and recover from the irritation of a self-electrocution; my ranting precipitated and precluded by a flight of frontotemporal epilepsy.</p>
				<p>At any one moment in time (besides those in seizing of course), our brains are poised on the precipice of entropy, manifest as seizure. The fluidity of the metabolic processes of the brain, and the maintenance of the environment necessary for these processes, are held to such exact standards that a single flux in either metabolism or environment yields an act of chaos. A change of blood pH by just 0.10 sends the body spiraling towards the grave, or an organized effort by multiple neuronal networks—enabled by constant activation of aspartate and glutamate receptors can —without the inhibition of GABA (the brains ever-watchful chemical conscience) — ripple like a wave in a stadium, through the brain and send me spiraling from my chair. The brain does not tend to entropy, as it has evolved to avoid it at all costs, but does not always succeed.</p>
				<p></p>		
				<p> Floors and walls bathed in sterile white. My eyes incurred flashes of pain. Infinitesimal barbed photons streaked at a speed of the function of <em>c</em> through my eyelids into my exposed retinas. The pupils shrunk in slow retreat from the borders of my eyes; the pain ebbed.</p>
				<p>Consciousness faded in. It did not turn on like the switch that released the biting light. No, consciousness exists in a continuous state, not a binary one, and in fluid motion slid from oblivion to awareness. </p>
				<p>“Dr. Allemanne can you hear me?”</p>
				<p>“This is Dr. Rotkod from Revelation Hospital. You suffered a seizure.”</p>
				<p>“A seizure, am I brain damaged?” I asked, as I processed complex formulas and concepts in my own self-assessment, “Prime numbers 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. . .Square root of 1,987 is 44.57. . .”</p>
				<p>“No, there was no permanent damage. The seizure was quite mild.”</p>
				<p>	“What could have caused a seizure? I have never had one in my life.” </p>
				<p>Satisfied with my self-assessment, I perused memories of childhood, memories of times fallen and times in hospital. No signs of seizure-derived amnesia here. Everything seems well. </p>
				<p>“It was caused by Ergotism we believe.”</p>
				<p>“And what is Ergotism?”</p>
				<p>“It is a poison caused by ingestion of ergot, a rye fungus.”</p>
				<p>“I have never heard of that.”</p>
				<p>“But you have likely heard of the result of ergotism, if untreated. It is the same disease that originated the idea of witches and subsequent deluded hunts for them in Salem. Hunters glimpsed the supernatural from an anomaly of neurochemistry, but did not see it in a vicious god, rather in certain women.”</p>
				<p>“Have you eaten any rye lately?” asked his curious nurse.</p>
				<p>In a fit of scatterbrain, I had ingested a piece of bread bought earlier than my mental model of the world had attributed thus acquiring the disease, or so my associates hypothesized. My peers and family in response to the sudden onset of my hermetic behavior adopted ergotism as an appropriate diagnosis. Only a disease associated with hallucinations, convulsions and other affections of the mind could cause me to relieve myself of all possessions and then in that end, also meet my end, as a living, breathing entrapped human, or so at least society dictates. However, it was not a simple infection that led to such a dramatic shift in my life’s work; it could not have been. The ergot plays an influence throughout this story, but at that time of such enlightenment I assure you I was free, and influenced by something greater. I believe it to have been something much greater, something that Anthony was in ally with. With the loss of that piece of art, I was not expressing an indirect wish of the infection, but my farewell to a reliance on objects of affection from which to derive myself through introspection. It was something of a great but so easily translucent power I served in that cavernous tree, until that final possession of mine was found, then sold, thereby allowing me to exasperate into bliss!</p>
				<p>Dr. Rotkod’s voice reeled me in from atemporal tangents, "Good news is that you are stable now and will make a full recovery from the ergotism.”</p>
				<p>“Terrific news. Am I free to leave? I must get back to my office. I have not had a drink in ages.”</p>
				<p>“You were here only a day, Sir. That is hardly a long time to be missing a drink. In fact you will be required to miss a drink for much longer.”</p>
				<p>“For how long? On what grounds doctor? A bit of ergot cannot take away a man’s tolerance! I’d say if anything, I’m stronger now for having survived.”</p>
				<p>“I am afraid we have some bad news. During our tests we discovered something serious.” </p>
				<p>He paused to let me prepare for the worst. The visual cortex gave me a slideshow in seconds of everything my imagination could conceive would come out of his mouth.</p>
				<p>“You should never have another single drink. You have a tumor developing in your liver. It appears stable for now, but in the coming weeks it will only become worse. The tumor is inoperable.”</p>
				<p>“Inoperable. Surely you could at least try, no?”</p>
				<p>“The tumor has assimilated into the liver. To remove it would mean removing the entire liver and at your age a transplant is not feasible.” </p>
				<p>“What about treatment?”</p>
				<p>“The presumably high alcohol diet has restricted the tumor’s growth somewhat, but any known drugs will also kill the liver. The assimilation is simply too far. We can begin treatment and pain management, but we can only realistically hope for another year.”</p>
				<p>“There is nothing else you can do?”</p>
				<p>“No, I am afraid we can only provide small doses of very targeted radiation in hopes of killing the tumor cells, but not the healthy liver cells.”</p>
				<p>“I read often about stem cells. Couldn’t you regrow any of the dead cells?”</p>
				<p>“No the studies are still inconclusive. The treatment has been very inconsistent in rats, and humans add another thick layer of complexity.”</p>
				<p>I had distracted myself with questions I knew the answer to. I had difficulty accepting this news, as anyone would. The end always seems a worry of the far future, yet years creep in without the knowledge of that perspective. The  perspective becomes unknowingly outdated until confronted by the harshness of life. </p>
				<p>“There is another option.”</p>
				<p>The doctor’s curious porosity broke my meditation. </p>		
				<p>“There is an experimental treatment in development here at this hospital that has passed all animal trials and has begun human trials. My colleagues are seeking out volunteers for the procedure. The procedure is called:  Selective Memory Eradifiction.TM </p>		
				<p>“Selective memory eradication? You can erase my memory selectively? Is this a new procedure?”</p>		
				<p>“A very new procedure invented by my colleagues Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak who work in research here at the Hospital. It is an alternative we hope to offer our terminal patients in lieu of typical pain management regiments, or currently illegal assisted suicides. We will erase your knowledge of the terminal disease, including for example the conversation we are having now, and every hour spent here.</p>
				<p>“The latter sounds brilliant!” I interject. </p>		
				<p>“Um…yes… you will leave this office without a single coherent memory of anything that has happened. You will believe to have been subject to an ordinary physical, nothing else.”</p>
				<p>“But I will leave still but months from death? And what about the pain? The complications of the disease? Won’t they just return the patients here?”</p>	
				<p>“Intelligent observation. Erasure of memory of course is not a cure. However there is an extended placebo effect, as we refer to it in the lab. By being unaware of the disease, the symptoms are ignored by the body. Ignorance of the disease lessens psychological stress, which impairs the immune system.  It is a phenomenon we still seek an explanation for. For an unknown reason a loss of awareness produces this effect, but the absence does not. A patient pre-diagnosis then will suffer despite not knowing what it is they suffer from, while a patient post diagnosis, who has no more conscious knowledge of his condition does not suffer. Well actually what if it is sub. . .” The doctor lowered his voice to a murmur as he stared off into space lost in his own musings. With a jolt of sudden self-awareness, snapped back to consciousness. “So, your choices are hospice or perhaps a year more of happiness from SME<sup>TM</sup>."</p>
				<p>I chose SME<sup>TM</sup>. I chose to forget the diagnosis and to live my last few weeks as well as I could.  I did this for my sons. I exchanged a longer life potential for the ability to give my sons more memories, better memories, memories of trips, eye-opening conversations and my pride in them. Cancer will not plague even the slightest remembrance of me. Their memory will not suffer due to my suffering. The neurons that can in a miracle of design express father will not be forever entwined with those that express cancer and the inevitable flood of emotions attached to it. Cancer will not be remembered, and the past must be better flavored.  I exchanged my memories for their memories. I exchanged their forthcoming life, for their past life. Their past life had been that which in memory only brought melancholy. They had only seen me through the distorted gloom of a brown bottle, and I had only seen them after the bottle. A brain resembles a sponge, but mine had been one, withholding naught but alcohol and contempt. </p>		
				<p>All things coveted are of earth and of earth only comes pain. I must empty my life of earth, and prepare to live.  I must give my sons all the potential memories in the hours of the weeks that followed, and ingrain in them the knowledge of a dead man. I had to forget all that led me to this epiphany, so I did, and so such a fairy tale death was possible. My apprehensive reader, you may doubt my euphemistic description, but in this current relationship I hold all the information, and in time smirking revelation will become you, and you will realize the magic of my untragic last breath. </p></div>
				
				
		<h2 id="father"> 3. Father </h2>
			<div id="father_content" style="display:none">
			<p>I exited the house onto Vidrar Way, a few (thousand) select neurons short. Memories of dreams unnerved me in the early morning. I went for a walk unaware of my impending death bar a subtle trembling recessed in the sub-conscience.  Dr. Rotkod had mentioned the potential for faint holdover, which may explain the bizarre coincidence of the simultaneous end of my life and my last imprint on the local economy, but not that I would ever remember the conversation. I relay this now with omniscience granted by the passing of life.</p>
			<p>I continued in such detached concentration that it was far too late by the time I realized I had missed my turn off of Vidrar Way. I came upon the wonderful smells of Bakers Lane; a unique section of the town not secluded to a single ethnicity and culture but to baking. The breads, pies, cookies here were the best in the region perhaps the world. I never traveled any farther than a bottle begged, but came here often enticed by the nostalgia of my childhood and memory of my father.</p>
		<p>A wonderful memory is a voice, my father’s voice. A voice that always read aloud my favorite story, a clever tale about a knight:</p>
		<p></p>
		<div class="indent">
		<p><em>Once upon a time there was a Knight who had to prepare for a dangerous battle with the foulest of trolls in the land of Rheinmark. He had faced many enemies, and was often victorious. He had slain dragons and kings. But the stories of the Troll's terror frightened him. The Troll placed his victims in burning pots of stew or ate them alive limb by limb. The knight decided that he could not lose his honor in any other manner other than death. He would face death for that is the code of Knights. Now, we have the pleasure of meeting that brave Knight </em></p>
		<p><em>I placed my suit of armor on and after a hesitation left the house. A poor beggar in rags sat outside my door in the alley. He threatened all who passed near him. I approached him and invited him to my life’s end, and explained that I must fight the most powerful Knight in the land.  “Your life’s end is already here!” he threatened, as he attacked me with an iron blade. I grabbed at his wrist, but fell victim to the unpredictability of the beginner. His iron blade slipped under my shoulder plate and into fragile flesh. All the worry over the battle vanished with the intense pain. Anger flashed quickly through my veins and in seconds I had the beggar by the throat following a swift thrust of his pitiful self into the stonewall.  The irony, I thought, that through the iron of a beggar I almost meet my life’s end.</em></p>
		</div>
		<p>I remember my father took me often to a place with the most ambrosial bread. Tasting that bread ruined a man. All other loaves were insipid bricks by comparison.</p>
		<p><em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em> was nestled in the cobbled corners of the quarter, where crowds of tourists, locals and jealous bakers jostled for the loaves of scare supply. My father had grown up with Renomme in Bakers Lane, and worked his first job with Renomme at Renomme’s bakery. He would still help Renomme on occasion so we never had to wait.</p>
		<p>I was a precocious baker and baked my own bread with Patrice, Renomme’s sister, while my father helped with the baking and chatted with Renomme. Renomme rarely had time for chatting since many a sniveling bake would buy one of each loaf to discern its secrets (imported French seed grown on a family farm) and many tourists made <em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em> their number one stop in the smallish city of Halvemaen.</p>
		<p>Flour hung in the air like morning fog over coastal bridges, and lightened the dark features of my father. The pace was fast but not in the sense that it was rushed, rather purposeful and enveloped in the joviality of a man doing what he loved, baking, and another doing what he truly loved, living. This was a cherished memory, and one of a collection of memories of my father, which I could never replicate with my own sons. </p>
		<p>I did not love living. I loved numbing and excluding myself from living. I filtered life out with alcohol and gave my sons a collection of scars, not memories.</p> 
		<p>As a small child, I thought I was the only person to in one instant wish horrific death on an innocent dog licking my face, then an instant later be in tears for having considered such a wretched act.I remember my father’s revelation to me of the prevalent flickers of horrific thoughts, of the intrusive thoughts as I came to learn about them in my psychological study.</p>
		<p>We encircled Serpent Lake in Hyde Park during a final trip to London, the eve of my father’s final battle with brain cancer. My father was a vehement Psychoanalyst, but the gentlest and most calming man I know. His voice was an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9RgbGLLfE">Arvo Pärt symphony</a>, at all times a eulogy, full of hope and security. It was with that voice of a rabbit resting he spoke to me the day before he died.</p>
		<p>“Throughout life you will face terrible attacks from the inner demons. They will come in many forms, and defy your internal fortifications. One form is most despicable. Impulse will pray on a natural defense. His finger alit with fire and smoke will probe into your mind and inject in an instant thoughts and desires only the extremity of evil could conceive. You must never follow these desires even if they appear endemic orders. Learn to immediately block them out of mind and shut the door on impulsive meddling.”</p>
		<p>In an instant he was dead. The following day he never awoke. Time may have pacified the <em>friedliche Sprache</em> but the voice survives in memory. Only through my memory and I, he survives. I could not deny my sons similar memories. I could not deny myself immortality by continuing to test their threadbare loyalty, less cared for than my Ferghan. </p></div>
		
		<h2 id="legendsend"> 4. Legend's End </h2>
			<div id="legendsend_content" style="display:none">
					<p>I found a depressing scene at <em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em>. Hoards of rats not customers covered the floor. Orders were not called out, rather a sorry oven coughed and smoked. A damp musty smell of rot, unfixed leaks, and stale flour swathed the scene.  The sight of an abandoned <em>La Boulangerie</em> recalled reality. I had lived this place in memory and in memory it was always an exciting and pleasant experience, but now I knew those times were gone, forever gone, and that permanence deeply saddened me. This was never to be a place where I was young for I would never again be young. This was never to be a place of tourism, for that time had its turn and is past. This was a dead place. I broke down into tears. I would soon join it. The tragedy of life: a gift at times so spectacularly beautiful yanked away at a moment’s notice or slowed into a different sort of drawn out agonizing pain.  Yet without unintended death, our art would suffer and all would suffer. Art finds much inspiration in death.  Without death, resources would be scarce and regardless, murder would reach a plateau of accepted normality. Stepwise my logic had progressed.</p>
		<p>At his peak, Renomme was the most famous baker in the entire world.  Today he was known to bake a weeks worth of bread for a single day or would bake only pain or only rye or would sometimes not bake at all rather wander the streets in search of a cat from his childhood. He was without family, without friends, without customers, without much function of his memory. Maybe a rat will endure a maze for bread, but not a member of an instant society. Some bakers helped him, but had businesses they needed to run and could only do so much for their former idol. The remaining envious considered his fall justice.  Renomme should have retired and entered a home but he was a legend and the end of a legend does not come with ease.</p>
		<p>I rubbed salty tears from my world-worn face and vowed to see this place into a proper closure. My peripatetic travels that day had drawn me here for some purpose. So from that day on for many weeks I returned to the shop of my youth. Now, to find Renomme.</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>I soon learned Renomme often wandered the dense web of cobbled lanes, peaking down every alley and lifting every mat in front of every door of the many busy bakeries. Customers were not happy to oblige him their place in line for the mere satisfaction of his deranged curiosity.</p>
		<p>“I have found Chaton!” I announced as I approached Renomme peering desperately into the window of a butcher’s shop.</p>
		<p>“Oh where? I have searched for her all day?” questioned Renomme.</p> 
		<p>His Mediterranean tone was only slightly visible beneath an uneven coating of flour like my Father had once wore flour. His bristled black hairs, a few white, stuck out from under his white hat, while under the hat remained only a far receded hairline. His nose was narrow, long with a small bump and below a smallish mouth. Short legs that matched the short arms supported his stout frame.  His clothes were disheveled and unflattering of his awkward roundness.</p>
		<p>“Chaton was asleep in the window of your shop as I past, nestled in the comforts of a deep <em>corbeille à pain</em>.”</p>
“Oh we must hurry back then. If this claim rings true, I must reward you”
	<p>I led the renowned Renomme back to his shop and on arrival the fleeting quality of his memories again appeared. Despite the memory afflictions, Renomme had retained his youthful sight. He navigated the twists and turns of neatly stacked loaves of miche with agile precision and disappeared into the kitchen, Chaton forgotten for another day.</p>
	<p>Renomme fired up the ovens again and was in argument with himself. I took his opportunity of the chef-distracted to pull the stacks and stacks of loaves fast fungus fodder out onto the street. I arranged them into a precarious tower and placed a sign in front signaling passerby’s of a unique bread deal: loaves for mere donations. With refrigeration and careful cutting, they would withstand the weekend, which was a time to be social, and to be social is to eat.</p>
	<p>People eat and drink with others to mutually enhance experiences that alone can be mundane. A first date is often paired with coffee or a fine wine. Humans are the sum of their metabolic processes and these processes are heightened by coffee or ignored by alcohol, but created by bread. So one did not want to run out of bread during the long weekend, when few to no shops were open. Many villagers picked up the extra loaf from Renomme for a modest donation, and afforded an old man some bread of his own.</p>
 	<p>A beautiful young woman passed me as I erected the bread tower. Her eyes were a beautiful brown and hazel, a stark similarity to the wares of an Alpen chocolatier. I knew her. Or did I? Perhaps I met her on my last visit, but there were many young women who passed by and I never remember seeing such a sumptuous woman, one whom I would have remembered. Could a woman with such glow be erased so easily? I glanced into the store, nothing but a bread maze. I hurried in but she was gone. Had I lost so much time in my thoughts? I must return. I must find her again. Not even the anticipation of the morning’s first drink gave me such excitement.</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Through the winter I came everyday to see her but she never came. Everyday I found the phantom cat. Everyday I waited two long hours in the afternoon in front of <em>La Boulangerie</em>em until Renomme threatened to call the police or his grandson to remove me, a man his elder, from loitering. Everyday I would see her walking down the street, with a confidence exuding from her every closing strut. Everyday it was but a second’s deception, morphing a common woman into my muse. Everyday I accepted this and returned to my worrisome family.</p>
	<p>Gabriel came often to try to pull me from my misapprehensions, “Father, you must not chase delusions of your degrading mind,” he pleaded.<p>
	<p>“Delusions! I am robust, and in perfect mental health, do not think I do not know what I am doing”</p>
	<p>"You stand there everyday awaiting an unknown, an unseen, an unimportant.”</p>
	<p>“Absolutely not! I await a woman, and despite being an old man, I want to end this life with love, with the reds of romance, not the dark grays of a murky dismal loneliness"</p>
	<p>"End? With Romance? I want to understand this. Had I seen the woman, maybe I could understand, but please just leave, come home. We miss you.”<p>
	<p>"Eh, lies, rotten lies. I had thought to spend more time there but not in that environment. Dante and you run everywhere. You incite punishment. You move in a tornado through my house with such disturbance all the thoughts in my head are shaken out, spread out on the floor, trampled, and imbibed an early death."</p>
	<p>"For once you are not viewing the world only through the distorted future of a bottle bottom! No,  instead you chase sober delusions, but a move from the bottle, despite direction, is a positive move according to us."</p>
	<p>"Through the bottom of the bottle? Speak not in ruse, or ill chase that with a bruise. And not these sober delusions you articulate"</p>
	<p>"Your rhymes are childish. I cannot come here everyday and shed a tear for you. Please do come to your senses.”</p>
	<p>Gabriel left in frustration. </p>
	<p>“I am on the brighter side of the fences, you will see in future tenses.”</p>
	<p>I went inside, frustrated with another fruitless day and thankless children.</p>
	<p>"Renomme, so why have you not retired? With such success, you should be in a yacht, back in France, in Nice, sipping wine all day and enjoying the luxury of a life of hard work"</p>
	<p>"Idleness on a bed of pillows wallowing in a swallow of water? No thanks! My work is not work in the sense you believe rather a purpose. Without this purpose I am without life"</p>
	<p>"Baking is your purpose? There is nothing else you would rather do?"</p>
	<p>“Yes. Everyone must have a purpose and mine lies in the art of wheat and yeast: bread. Without a purpose one work’s for nothing, and happiness impossible to maintain.”</p>
	<p>“I see truth in your reasoning. I have since abandoned my work for a bigger purpose: to find this woman. I do not seek a mate, or maybe I do? I do not know what answers she may have or motivations she may provide me but I have an intuition that I must find her. What about your family Renomme, were you ever married?</p>
	<p>"Enough with this conversation. I must check the miche." </p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Resolute in my confidence and dedication I remained. I never missed a day, two hours a day, from the first flake to freeze to the last one to melt, I waited. Two hours a day without my sons. Two hours a day extrapolated over a winter amounts to days wasted. I missed days of memories. I welcomed a premature death to loiter in front of a bakery of senility. I spent a winter, my last, heaped in anticipation for a woman I would leave in death as my wife left me. I would leave the woman with the threat of alcoholism and the care of children she had no stake in. Again I looked at my sons through a bottle darkly, but a bottle of failed consideration rather than spurn.</p> </div>
			
			
			<h2 id="patience"> 5. Patience Through the Seasons </h2>
			<div id="patience_content" style="display:none">
							<p>The rustle of autumn is the rustle of exasperation, of an end as leaves leave. A long time apart from water they have dried and cracked in the dry cold of approaching winter. A pair of feet on an afternoon’s walk compresses the dried, brittle remains crushing the former ripe leaf, now a lifeless shadow, into folic dust.</p>
			<p>The rustle of spring is an antithesis of the rustle of autumn, and rightly so—it’s a rustle of beginning not end.  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Gaddlgqgo"><em>Frühlingrauschen</em></a> arrives at the dawn of the season, and is the source of the inertia that pushes through the summer. The rustle of people emerging from a winters slumber, from a slow life of early nights and late mornings into a full, energized day. The day enlivened by the sun. Trees enlivened with new crisp green leaves; life sprouts everywhere from the duck’s pond to the feeble crack ignored by the stream of passing soles above.</p>
			<p>In this day of rustling spring, I awaited my future wife, the women from the bakery with the eyes of luscious chocolate, or so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale#Terminology"><em>Märchen</em></a> of a new season had enamored me. We had yet to speak but the glance of a moment was a tome of a lifetime. I needed not more. I had seen a winters snow arrive and recede.</p>
			<p>I waited for her. I picked at the petals of a red rose. I pinched the tip of a petal, gave a tactless tug like that of an inquisitive infant, then released and repeated. Some petals fell to the slight pulls and decorated the cobbled stoned beneath my feet. Soon she should have to accept a stem, and if so, the <em>Märchen</em> of the season had such a hold on me to allow to me believe new petals would without doubt emerge at the moment of her presence. I continued to pick at and accidentally pluck.</p>
	<p>“Buy or move on, this store is not a bus stop!”</p>
	<p>“Come inside, get a broom and sweep the sidewalk if you are going to loiter there all day.”</p>
	<p>“I have an old gramophone in need of some fixing. Nicolas always says that playing music to the streets will bring more customers from the streets. Help an old man out!“</p>
	<p>Everyday Renomme threatened me, or made demands, and requests. He wore his usual disheveled bakers white,  and a delicately hooked mustache upon his wrinkled elder skin long worn by some 50 years in front of a baker’s oven. Yesterday, I had conceived a solution. Today he did not even offer me a glance.</p>
	 <p>Renomme busied himself not with bread, but with Pain, the cat. The endless traffic of questions had bothered me into irrationality. I bought the demented man a cat, more my cat then his. He would never remember to feed or care for it. Not to say he would not want to nor would offer it love, but a cat cannot live on good intentions alone. For now my daily trips to Bakers Lane in hope of meeting the woman prevented an inconvenience. Soon the cat would need a proper home. Maybe Praline, as I had begun to call the mystery women, the schockolade-eyed sphinx, would take the cat. We could raise the cat together, both too old for more children. I already had chosen a name, Pain, short for Pain de Seigle. For the rye is what had brought me back every day. It was the reason I first saw her, and the reason we will first meet one of these days. If only Renomme could remember her!</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	 <p>The flower was now a stem.</p>
	 <p>A failed flower!  A failed day! This is madness! I cannot endure much longer. </p>
	 <p> My grip unconsciously loosened and the stem slipped onto the stones. The urge to crush it came to me, to eviscerate it, to spread the green juices in a vicious display of my despair, to diffuse the green blood of life across the cold concrete. I felt the hellish finger penetrate my skull in a flicker. I resisted and bent down to retrieve the stem. Lengthy aged-to-perfection legs blurred in the peripheral of my vision. </p>
	 <p>Praline!</p>
	 <p>I snatched the stem and rose with vigor, but the second of a glance away must have been in an hour on clock of healthy logic, for only Renomme was in the shop. There was a streak of fobgn light. </p> 
	 <p>The backdoor was cracked. It was never cracked. </p>
	 <p>I dashed into the store and made little attempt to follow the intent of the maze. My shoulders toppled stack after stack. I hurdled the counter and came crashing down into Renomme, but a week’s worth of bread broke his fall, and his minds video camera, as always, soon ate the tape of this malice. I tripped, stumbled and caught myself on the doorknob, clasping with one hand. My weight and inertia forced it open, as my falling motion turned the knob. I lay on my back, and glanced toward the end of the alley, a moving shadow bended around the corner. With the lean of sprinter I took off from my block. I reached the street, and dug my soles into the ground coming to a wobbly stop before the busy thoroughfare. A mass of people flowed in front of me, but there was no Praline in site. Behind I could hear Renomme shouting at me in French, “. . .fou . .” and behind him Pain chasing something invisible or small, maybe ants. I made a slow return to apologize to Renomme. </p>
	 <p>“I am very sorry Renomme. I thought I saw a women go through this back door. A women I have been waiting to meet for many months.”</p>
	 <p>“This door? No one uses dies door, except my Petite Allemanne”</p>
	 <p>“Excuse me, who?”</p>
	 <p>“My Petite Allemanne.“</p>
	 <p>“You named him after me?”</p>
	 <p>“Ah of course, when you are not here to visit me, Petite Allemanne is equal company. He cannot buy bread, so I only call him after you and not you after him despite the joy he gives me, while you stand in front of my store littering it with dead flowers!”
Renomme went back through the door, clutching an unwilling Petite Allemanne.</p>
	<p>I leaned against the wall and took the loaf I had bought earlier out of my coat. I pulled pieces off to eat as I pulled my thoughts together. The soft lighting emitted a welcoming ambiance in the shop but prevented obvious detection of the ergot growing on the bread. Ergot is a sullied yellow-green, not serene or lively as yellow can be, no, the vulnerable yellow fell victim to unpleasant contamination, like sulfur or mucous.</p>
	<p>With emerging tradition, I tossed the stem that was still in my hand, aside, then soothed another day’s disappointment with some Pain, one I ate, and one who purred with the fit of an engine struggling to life. Pain had escaped Renomme’s clutches. The fitful purr soothed, though it was a sad purr for such a happy cat. Perhaps a sad purr is better for bone strengthening since purring is not emotional expression but a lazy method of increasing bone density for an animal that sleeps 19 hours a day.</p>
	<p>Pain climbed up onto a small ledge to the right and rubbed his head against mine, and I rubbed mine against his. I filled his dish, gave him a goodbye behind-the-ears-scratch and set off towards home.</p> 
	<p>The freewill I gave my mind, to wonder and wander through imagined future years, made me feel nothing but a nauseous doom. An audible monologue progressed in my head.</p>
	<p>The Sunday afternoons, and a new mom for my sons, the woman with the <em>schockolade</em> eyes, were so innocent and beautiful in nature, yet a subconscious voice pawed at the surface. The doom and horror bloated my gut, and I could not escape these feelings. I fought them to a standstill every day I waited for the women, never attaining her, a victory of the subconscious, yet never giving up, a victory for me. My strength finally wavered, beaten down by the narrow loss. I came so close to attain her, closer than I had ever come, but lost her. My sprit was crushed, my Ego victorious. The Id lost.</p>
	<p>Again I collapsed – in a swirl of nausea and confusion. I collapsed not from untreated cancer or epilepsy, but from an unsure idea. My hesitant mind induced my body into a numbing stress. Competing neural programs were gridlocked.</p>
	<p>The woman I saw was but a phantom, like Renomme’s Chaton, an ergotic concoction perhaps: my late wife. Why would she appear? It had been so long. Or was it her? I could no longer recall her form, her beauty. My memories of her were long lost following a nebulous hospital stay, one likely of alcohol but not certain.</p>
	<p>I had wasted a life, lived each day and each day erased by a lack of self-control. My weak mind served the bottle. My wife, she died at the moment of Dante’s birth. She gave her life for him. Her spirit traded his, and always I viewed him with disdain as only half the person she was. He was a parasite that once finished feeding, let his host wither with an ugly convolution of life into the grave. I could never forgive him but could not remember the love which when lost gave justification for the inability to forgive.</p></div>
	
	
		<h2 id="antearbore"> 6. Ante Arbore </h2>
			<div id="antearbore_content" style="display:none">
						<p>The wealth of centuries, of my family’s history was scattered throughout my office. The impressive glint of a sword—light abstractions—retracted my pupils.</p>
		<p>The animal instinct is so involuntary. My frontal lobe relinquished processing authority to the primitive reptilian hindbrain. A match fluttered alit, fell and tumbled match head over matchstick onto my latest writing. The words with the obverse ease in which they were written, vanished. I grabbed the pages in front of me, to read them, to watch the fire read them, consuming each word leaving behind ash, the words transformed. The ignited ashes detached and floated around the room onto the threads of the Ferghan, woven in the year of the first crusade. Flames fluttered, entropic movement according to the dynamics of present oxygen and the health of the source: a one-of-a-kind rug formed into the holy tatters of the carpet of a downtrodden poet too lost in his work to segregate ashes to a tray.</p>
		<p>I became fixated on the loss of wealth before my eyes; the carpet’s reduction to a black worthless ash pile, carbon and smoke forever appropriated throughout the atmosphere, thrilled me. The loss of responsibility for an object, the anxiety over its preservation, the endless professional cleanings, and wealth put forth to protect this vault of wealth, excited me.</p>
		<p>I stamped it out! I rescued the remains! Not out of a return of a need neither to perpetuate this anxiety nor to continue to enjoy the constant upkeep of a museum piece, but because the same destruction could occur without such senselessness. Why feed all my possessions to fire when I could donate them? I could sell them to give my sons an insurance of a decent life, and donate the rest to caring hands. They could not be given to the government, or the ministry of a demonstration of the shortcomings of human nature, as the news so often inspires me to name it. No, perhaps an orphanage or a museum of the Allemanne family would be better. All will be donated, the history of the pieces taught, and the richness of the collection maintained in knowledge, not quantified currency. </p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>I took a step out the door, and down the stone steps. The blustery winds blew over the river and forced my body to a rigid bend, my shoulders hunched, face parallel to the ground, as the top of my head bravely faced the sting of cold.  I resisted the winds push and raised my head in a reverse of the rigid duck I was forced into earlier. I paused and became entranced by the eternal slow flow of the river a couple hundred meters from my door.</p>  
		<p>The humid sea breeze lulled me into a mind-wandering vision. In a single breath past my eyes played out the history of this river, a maritime battlefield of no match in history. Before my eyes castles fell; ships sunk; marauders came and went, drowned and pillaged; explorers arrived for the greatness of intellect rather than the greatness of the sword; barges replaced warships; garish tourist ships appeared; in a fast approach a Viking and his axe crashed into my vision!</p>
		<p>I opened my eyes and stretched up to see nothing but the historied river pushing on into a future far more enduring than mine.</p>
		<p>This section of earth had rotated away from sun, and darkness fell. Herr Lehman stepped out the gatehouse as I approached the end of the drive. He unfastened the locks and pushed the large iron gate open. Before slipping through the gap, I approached him.</p>
		<p>“Herr Lehman, hold out your hand if you would”</p>
		<p>“For what reason Herr Allemanne?”</p>
		<p>“Please, do as I say, the sooner you do, the sooner the answer is revealed”</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir”</p>
		<p>Into his hand I set a velvet bag weighed down by a decades salary for a gatekeeper.</p>
		<p>“Your services are no longer needed here, Mr. Lehmann. I appreciate the unwavering loyalty and hard work. Here is your salary in full for the next ten years, a wager based on the best guess I could make for how much longer I would have lived”</p>
		<p>“I cannot take this, Dr. Allemanne. I cannot accept a wager on your life. Excuse me Sir but I am overwhelmed at the moment. I do not understand.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, no need to understand, appreciate the mystery. Now see that this gate is refastened and I wish you and your family the best.”</p>
		<p>“But, Sir -”</p>
		<p>His voice quieted behind my hurried pace towards the Cathedral.</p>
		<p>As I crossed the city, I made a regretful decision to enter Reganplatz. I was an unarmed civilian in a swarm of enemy soldiers. From every side bulky bags and pointed corners of shoeboxes wounded me. Consumerism transformed into an army of senseless selfish robots battering me without conscience. I felt so insecure, so out of place. Not a friendly eye, yet here is happiness being bought by the bagful — happiness that will subside as quickly as the swipe of a card, unlike happiness of an experience, which is idiosyncratic thus resistant to the decay of social comparison. Like the hounds of Chateau Chaverny, a group frothed at the entrance to their next short-lived high waiting inches behind the closed store glass. Impulse abounds.</p>
		<p>Today was also a sports day. The city brimmed with jungle cries from citizens dressed for battle, in decorative patterns of three colors that solidified in-group membership, and some believed, superseded common decency. Halvemaen played against another city, which I lack the intimate knowledge of the sport (whichever one it was this winter season) to relate. Even in this state of omniscience, my apathy persists. A menagerie of players with no connection to this city played against a menagerie from another city, equal in vague connection. The result was Halvemaen cheering for a brand, the colors and shapes that never changed in contrast to the players who always changed. In a fault of misattribution, they believed love of city meant love of the brand, and sought to confirm their own preconception of loving a city with biased interpretations and memories.  They believed their brand to be the best becoming hostile when their superiority was not respected.  To the threatening mascot, the fans loyalty lied, and to ridiculous violence they defended the brand. Their testosterone rose and fell with their team, and like the rise and fall of musical notes, played out a tragic scene in man.</p>
		<p>At the end of the <em>platz</em> was St. Anthony’s Cathedral, whose disproportionately tall openwork spires sprawled into the heavens like the spreading branches of a tree. The cathedral rested on the border of the far reaches of my estate and its muddy trails prevented swifter passage. The aged charcoal cathedral seemed a stone skeleton with a vaulted torso, cribbed flying buttresses and clerestory windows coming to flamboyant arches. St. Anthony’s displayed the underlying order and rationality of the universe in its geometrical and mathematical construction, and a collateral aesthetic of magnificence.  From the Himmelturm, or heaven tower, one could look out and see almost all directions the edge of the city as it met the edge of a present twilight sky. In only one direction, was the view hindered.</p>
		<p>The Himmelturm was shadowed by our Yggdrasil, so named for its similarity to the tree of life of Norse mythology, a <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em> or Ash tree of atypical dimensions. The pollard tree bulged at the bottom, and progressively narrowed towards the top where it became a thicket of branches. The arms were bare and stretched to all directions. Here I made my home.</p>
		<p>I knocked on the great doors of St. Anthony’s in hope the monks had finished evening prayer and could have me. I could not wait until the sun came around again.</p> 
		<p>The great door opened with the reluctance, speed and fluidity of a languorous giant. A modest monk in drab gray invited me in with cheerfulness unexpected of one in such ascetic dress.</p>
		<p>“Dr. Allemanne, if you are here for our latest Trappist brew, we will not open the cellar for another hour. But we are pleased to see you and have missed you the past few months. Is everything alright with your family?” 
I crossed the threshold and stepped aside as Luke shoved closed the giant door.</p>
		<p>“This is a time like none other,” I responded. “All is more than well. In fact, I have come to you about my family, and in regards to some other particulars concerning them. Follow me please, Luke” 
I hurried forwards in a fast walk that evolved into an elated jog.</p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne where are you going?”</p>
	<p>I traversed the transept, reached the end of the sanctuary, climbed up the stairs past the altar and slipped behind into a narrow passage, the <em>semita latenter</em>. The passage was but a few footfalls before I reached a dead end. Before me was a rod-iron ladder.</p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne, no has been up that ladder since I took my vows here almost 25 years ago. It is not safe! Please Sir, come down! Tell me what it is you wanted to say. I must be hurrying back to my chambers to prepare for this evenings Bible study.”</p>
	<p> The ladder held, and the height was dizzying, but the view spectacular.  Luke sat against the curved wall to the right of me with his legs scrunched and pressed up to his chest.</p>
	<p>“Afraid of heights? I used to be but now this height does not seem any higher to me than that first step on the ladder. Fear is only psychological and can be overcome with cunning.”</p>
	<p> Himmelturm had a large hollowed cone for a roof and earned its name from its 150-meter height, a skyscraper of its day. When the church had been built centuries earlier, this tower was not in the original design. Sir Edward Bakermary, a wealthy Lord, and avid Bible scholar in a misguided interpretation of the Holy Scriptures had it built. He built it taller than anything anyone in this part of the world had seen at the time. He built it to test God, just as the devil had tested Jesus in the desert. He invited Jesus to show himself the Son of God by falling from a great height and in doing so assuredly being saved by his heavenly father. Sir Bakermary did not believe he was testing God, only demonstrating his faith.”</p>
	<p>The platform was the shape of a toothless key. A round head, with a small opening that stretched downwards the length of the ladder, and a long rectangular stone slab, like a diving board extended from one edge to two meters out into the open air.  
Bakermary climbed the tower, said a small prayer then shuffled forwards to the edge of the slab. Afraid of heights, he rotated and then let himself fall backwards, expected to be caught by a gust of heavenly wind. His faith buckled under his weight and in horrid awe the crowd below watched him fall terminal at terminal velocity. They scattered, none brave or strong enough to break his lengthy fall. His petrified wife made no movement. All the weight fell on her, and together they were forced into the earth from whence they came, dead, in such tragedy. The church condemned Bakermary as reckless, and sought to distance itself from one who would dare test god, a god who valued mindless conformity and obedience of custom and authority over human life.</p>
	<p>I dangled my legs above the Bakermary’s grave, and invited Luke to at least turn his head out over the grounds, and my acres.
“See, Yggdrasil out there Luke”	</p>
	<p>“Yes, Sir, the ash tree” </p>
	<p>“From the mansion at the far end to the tree on the border, and all in-between, from the far fence out past the well,” I pointed west “to the iron fence below, that marks the border between my property and Gods, I give that to the church, to your church, Luke.” </p>
	<p>“That is a very generous donation, Sir. Abbot Wilhelm will be very pleased. We had been hoping to open a school soon, and were afraid we would have to relocate to an area farther away from the city where there is more land, but your house and the grounds will serve God in this purpose very well. You must certainly be a wellspring of God’s pride. I thank you. The church thanks you. That old ash tree will be the first thing to go. It has not shown a leaf in a score of years, and harbors only insects in its hollowed tomb. I fear it could tumble down at any moment, save for the thick trunk keeping it rooted.”</p>
	<p>“Yggdrasil stays. I apologize for not mentioning it earlier but the tree stays. Do you have any extra robes?”</p>
	<p>“Robes? Sir”	</p>
	<p>“Yes, a drab gray one such as yours. You must keep extras for those who may answer God’s call in the future”	</p>
	<p>“Oh, these robes,” Luke in his humble style pinched a section of the rough, dry, sackcloth forward, “Abbot Wilhelm should have a few spare in his office. We monks are not as neat as one may think, and this cloth although cheap attracts dirt far more easily than one likes” </p>
	<p>“Could you fetch one for me? I’m willing to pay. 5 Geld?”</p>
	<p>“Sir! 5 Geld is a year’s tithe for some of our members. That is not necessary. Your generous donation will cover the modest cost of a monk’s cloth. But may I ask for what reason you are requesting a robe? Your clothes are the finest in the city.”
“Here is 5 Geld, now I have wasted much time enjoying this spectacular view and must be off. Please hurry back with the robe.” I dropped the coins into the pockets of his robe.</p>
	<p>Luke’s confounded mind slowed to a pensive pause, mouth gaping, but I ignored them, walking to the edge. Luke descended into the tower.</p> 
	<p>I pulled my decorative kurta, a gift from an Indian prince, over my head, and tossed the kurta up into the air like a bird first learning to fly. In the wind it became an unmasted sail not resisting the push and pull of the wind. The garment settled on the grass far below, soon joined by the rest of my pretentious clothes. I stood at the edge of the diving platform, imagining a loch of the Scottish highlands inviting me from below. The wind gusts were strong and near constant. A thought of Lucifer’s, one entered prying and prodding in my mind, to test God, to lean forward just a little and the let God’s Grace assist in my defiance of gravity, but could not, for I did not harbor the faith of Bakermary. No I had an instinctual drive for preservation that lay incognito, secluded from the meddling of the dangerous consciousness.</p>
	<p>“Sir, Dr. Allemanne, please step back, my heart is pounding from here. I have brought two robes, one gray like mine and another purple like the Abbots, which I think may be a better wear for a man of your stature. I also insist that your previous donations are satisfactory. Please keep the 5 Geld, and insure a philanthropic life for your sons. I insist sir.”</p>
	<p>“No the gray one will do, and my sons have enough. 5 Geld will insure them nothing but material of this world. I ask that you take them in, care for them, and teach them of faith, and belief, which is the only currency that can buy what is truly important. I must go now. They will be finished with their studies, soon. Ill have Ms. Steinhurst bring them by.”</p>
	<p>I had provided Ms. Steinhurst with a salary, but for her projected life not mine. She became the legal guardian of my sons from now until her death. </p>
	<p>From the cathedral, I turned not right to home, but left to follow along the road that brought the wheat and fruits of the surrounding farmers into town. I once had not even considered a foot upon this peasant path.  Anytime I had to cross, I required my driver cover it in a rich red velvet carpet for my feet, which I believed deserved better than even the most clever peasant mind.</p> 
	<p>I wandered along the path for quite some time as the houses became less densely packed and gave way to large pastures with cows, goats and sheep grazing. Dusk came and went. Moonshine lit the path behind me. 
I had never walked so long and so far, not since I was a boy.</p> 
	<p>Exerted, I reached and rang the knocker of the Bauer household. Nothing.</p>
	<p>I knocked again.</p>
	<p>An inquisitive light came on with murmurs, then a loud, “Who comes by a tired farmers door so late in the night during the harvest?” </p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne. I could use a place to rest my—”</p>
	<p>“We don’t have your money! You took it all last month. We must live on the small garden in the back now.”</p>
	<p>“Please, I do not come to collect debts. Let me in, and let me rest a bit. I have business to discuss.”</p>
	<p>Silence until sunrise. I huddled next to the door in chilled reluctant sleep. </p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Before the sun, another light awoke me. The door creaked open behind me. A work-worn face, with permanent bags hanging beneath the eyes and a few gray hairs poking out around the chin greeted me in twilight of an important day. Herr Bauer, a man in his early looking 60 but actually in his 40s invited me in.</p>
	<p>I entered the modest house. Inside, there was a wooden table, nicked and dented with charming peeled paint. Next to the table was a medieval fireplace below many hanging black pots. The fireplace smoldered mild warmth in subtle reflection on the soot-stained walls. Simple and cozy. “ Please, sit down–Dr. Allemanne, you said?” Herr Bauer said.</p> 
	<p>“Yes, that is I.”</p>
	<p>“But you are dressed as Monk. Have you been drinking all night and into the morning at the Trappist’s and ruin your clothes? Religious men they say, but never seem to deny you drink or your generous offers of alms that follow.”</p>
	<p>His wife approached the table. “Would you like a drink, all I have to offer is peasants brew?”</p>
	<p>“I find that quite apt for these robes, a peasant brew sounds delicious.”</p>
	<p>She brought us each a cup. I took a long sip and felt the caffeine taking command of my neural chemistry. The caffeine binds to the neurons and blocks adenosine’s slowing effects. The block signals emergency and adrenaline and dopamine are released, a natural energized high.  </p> 
	<p>“No I have adopted a more spartan lifestyle, one that does not require such lavish raiment. I have passed my fortune onto the Abbey for their school and am here to cancel your debts and assure your children a proper education.”</p>
	<p>He rubbed his puzzled old face.</p>
	 <p>“Now, was it about 2 years ago that I financed your new barn?”</p>
	 <p>“I believe, so. We had Martina heading off to private school and could not afford both her education and a new barn. Then our prices at the market were forced down by competition from other towns, but interest on our debts increased. We had to borrow or fail.”</p>
	 <p>“Friend, and truly I mean friend, I regret that past of mine. I come here today to cancel that debt.”</p>
	 <p>“Sir I cannot settle any debts. I can barely afford my payments. Please leave, leave if that is what you are here for. Unless you want this shirt from my back. It’s soaked with more work than you have ever imagined behind your antique desk, golden pens, and wealth built upon the precarious backs of us workers!”</p>
	 <p>I let him vent. I let him express. Then intervened, not wanting him to be too worked up. Too stressed. I know how stress ages one. </p>
	 <p>“Perhaps you misheard. I said cancel not settle these debts and will accept nothing but agreement in this. As of today, all the geld you owe me is null and void. Here is all the interest that have you paid in full. I have no need for it. Thank you for the coffee. I must go and make many more visits.”</p>
	 <p>Herr Bauer transformed from an expression of desperate stress to disbelieving elation. I had no time and left him.</p>
	 <p>And on and on I went, house to house throughout the countryside. I visited all my debtors and canceled all the debts to astonishment, disbelief and at the end of weapons. My pockets lightened, as did my heart. A day later I entered town elated, almost ready to retreat to my shell. One more important visit remained.</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>I entered the sterile foyer and felt as aesthetically pleased as I would in a hospital. The furniture was perfect but a style fitting of hotel lobbies and dim waiting rooms, impersonal and exuding corporate banality. Furniture for one who created the safe and overdone, with class of decades before, if one would even say those post-war decades had class. Not even dust seemed to have used the cloy flowers and dull patterns to rest. I chose to stand.</p>
	<p>The Mayor’s office, like the foyer, was elite but impractical, exorbitant but uncomfortable.</p>
	<p>“Mikhail, I am here on behalf of our farmers. They cannot afford the drive into Halvemaen. Many plan to cut themselves off entirely and only grow what they need, return to the simple life. This is not sustainable. The farmers supply most of the town’s produce. I have relieved all my personal debts, but we must relieve them further.”</p>
	<p>“Why are you here to discuss fire and brimstone? I have lowered your taxes further and now await the generous return to my campaign. Plus we receive plenty of canned produce.”</p>
	<p>“Have you ever tasted those canned vegetables? They are only enticing in their manipulative decoration.”</p>
	<p>“No, but the people don’t seem to mind it. Here have a drink Dr. Allemanne.”</p>
	<p>I downed the drink. The caffeine had worn and the alcohol would relieve the headache. In my previous state of mind, even a single drink would have been the start of a riotous evening. Now all had changed.</p>
	<p>“Unlike you, I am not motivated by altruism. I don’t succumb to the “good feelings” of “good deeds.” Disparity is the function of nature. A rabbit is born a rabbit and suffers a more miserable fate at the jaws of a wolf than the wolf at the jaws of old age. You see, we were born the wolf and must live our lives as the wolves, for it is nature’s structure. The farmers were born the rabbits and so live as rabbits, subject to every whim of our jaws. It is the pre-determinism of nature.”</p>
	<p>“But life is not so facile or disgusting. Martina Bauer. Does this name sound familiar?”</p>
	<p>“Bauer sounds a peasant title and that’s all I know.”
“Well, what happens when a rabbit becomes a wolf? She is the daughter of Henri and Hannah Bauer. They took a loan from me a couple years back to send her to university. And in her two years, she has already become a renowned scholar and leader. She is the top of her class and now earns full scholarship.”</p>
	<p>“A rabbit that dresses as a wolf, is still a rabbit, or is transfiguration an idea you also propose as truth?”</p>
	<p>“She does not attend the public university. She follows in the footsteps of this past century’s great leaders and attends our Alma Mater. She has her eye on politics too and seeks a better life for her parents.”</p>
	<p>“These tales of dreams reached and higher-class breached by lower-class is an anomaly. We designed the system in accordance with nature and so not even the quickest rabbit will escape the jaws of the wolf.”</p>
	<p>“Top banks and consulting firms have already tried to recruit her. They will not let this so-called quick rabbit of talent slip into the jaws of a wolf. She deserves this chance, and so do many others. I envision a society where all can have true equal opportunity and not the mere façade of it, as is currently propagated by politicians. We live in a society with burgeoning rifts that only hate will soon fill.”</p>
	<p>“Save your paranoiac thoughts for unread books.”</p>
	<p>“This is not paranoia. Her talent, her word, her story will become viral, will spread and infect the mind and push out the strict patriotic thought that permeates the misinformed. We do not live in a society of liberty, fraternity or equality. Illusions of safety have superseded liberty, fraternity is as empty as the regard two passing strangers hold for each other, and inequality emerges in even the most trivial ways.”</p>
 	<p>“While this all sounds unfortunate, you cannot expect me to shoot myself in the foot.”</p>
 	<p>“We both know you would suffer at most a prick. You have enough savings to live ten times as comfortable as the farmers. Instead you live upon them and the support is faltering. If I cannot convince you of change, then I am here to warn you of inevitable revolt and I hope this warning means bloodless revolt, and not a revolt ending with your head upon a stick. Martina is beyond violence but her story will resonate with all leviathanless classes that hone pitchforks as well as we hone finances. Though it is no concern for me. I have retired to a monk’s life and will no longer be an accomplice to this profligate existence.”</p></div>
		
		
		<h2 id ="yggdrasil"> 7. Yggdrasil </h2>
				<div id="yggdrasil_content" style="display:none">
				<p>“Nichts ist heiliger, nichts ist vorbildlicher als ein schöner, starker Baum. Ein Baum spricht: In mir ist ein Kern, ein Funke, ein Gedanke verborge, ich bin Leben vom ewigen Leben. Einmalig ist der Versuch und Wurf, den die ewige Mutter mit mir gewagt hat, einmalig ist meine Gestalt und das Geäder meiner Haut, einmalig das kleinste Blätterspiel meines Wipfels und die kleinste Narbe meiner Rinde. Mein Amt ist es, im ausgeprägten Einmaligen das Ewige zu gestalten und zu zeigen.”</p>
<p><em>[“Nothing is sacred, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. A tree says: Hidden within me is a core, a seed, a thought. I am life from eternal life. Unique is the trial and throw, which with the eternal mother dared me, unique is my form and the veins of my skin, unique are the smallest leaves of my treetop and the smallest scars of my bark. My purpose is to form and show the distinct uniqueness of eternity.”]
</em></p>
<br>
	<p>Yggdrasil was a cathedral of the forest. The hollowed core rose 10 meters above my head. An apartment in the city was not as spacious on the inside of my natural dorter. I did not hold the space as a demonstration of wealth, rather respected the sheer brilliance of nature’s architecture. Fractions of light shone through small holes made by burrowing insects and animals.</p>  
	<p>In the tree, I had the monks robe for clothes, a pile of straw for sleeping, a few candles, many journals with some pen and ink, and a months baking of Renomme’s <em>Pain dé Seigle</em>, which stayed fresh in the chill atmosphere of the tree’s core.</p> 
	<p>The bread was the extent of the legacy of the Renomme. <em>La Boulangerie de Renomme and Renomme</em> had burned, consumed by an audacious oven fueled by an absent mind. A few days before the fire, I made a farewell visit collected some bread and another Pain, the feline of diversion.</p> 
	<p>Far from my straw pile I had set up a garderobe. Twists and turns of the trees trunk had made a Y-shape, and where the two lines of the Y came together it was deep enough, and wide enough for me to sit down comfortably. I carved a large hole out, and deep down into the grounds, where no smell could disturb my life’s remaining reflection.</p>
	<p>Often I lay on the mat and listened to the voices transcribing my auditory hysteria into a journal or more. Often I found myself waking from a state not of sleep but consciousness, staring at nothing, with not even a fool’s guess of the time or day and a seconds processing to construct a mental model of the present. Often I became detached from memories’ recollection and architecture of time and space.</p>	
	<p>Woodcarving became not a hobby, only a skill I acquired out of necessity, if one could even say I had acquired it. So the door to my hollowed home was rudimentary, a carving of cave men who invented the spoon, and not yet the knife. My life as a whole had become rudimentary.  The padlock that secured the entrance was its most advanced mechanism. Together with the moss and knots that ensconced the rough outline of a hinged opening, it protected me from world, from the nosiness and greed, the perpetual whine of a society fit to be swine.</p>
	<p>I did not wish to abandon my sons, and had not forgone surgery, life-saving surgery, just to grant them a few more memories.  Not memories of my health that would tease them with many years together to only strip them of any hope when I passed at the verge of an apparent recovery, but memories of days that they would keep till the end, memories to serve as the reference point for all memories to come.  But I was torn. I had to abandon this greed, and omit my possessions, live a Monk I must, or so the voices spoke as they trailed off at the precipice of entropy. I must show them how one is to live.</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>My eccentric transition had earned me a quizzical fame, and one devotee was a doctor. He was a clinical psychologist whose apparent method was to make you the doctor while adopting the role of patient. Without much else to do in my hollowed tree he figured his daily lectures would be gratifying; that our dialogues—if it is possible for only one person to speak in a dialogue—would enlighten a breakthrough in psychological science and in his enigmatic being.</p>
	<p>“My mind is a puzzle with dynamic pieces, shape shifting and color changing, in order to hide the truth beneath an overwhelming exponential set of possibilities”</p>
	<p>This was a quote spoken during one of our ‘dialogues’ during which he always sought answers to his own mental afflictions rather than cure mine. Not that I asked him to cure them or for me to cure his.
 	<p>I pushed the large, sectioned, hinged root that masked my entrance up to see his face, not my dried fruit or ever persuading and begging children. Without room for another body, or any wish to expose my sanctuary, we began to carry out these conversations with the root section propped open wide enough for voices to exchange bot nothing else.</p>
 	<p>"As a child in Moscau, I was a drop of the ocean without another drop in my company. I was a drop separated and left alone to moisten an expansive desert. I was alone despite all odds contesting it,” began our first conversation.</p>
	<p>"That is quite sad,” I replied.</p>
	<p>"I walked to the train station and followed families around. I pretended I was their son. Often though I was caught by the conductor or manager and sent back home, to the streets. This continued until I learned the conductor’s routes and schedules and moved car to car or stashed my boyish body with the suitcases. I always dressed in brown to blend in better. At first the families would scold me for having run from my own, but my persistence was for young parents too saddening to ignore. Soon their scolds were invites into a world I only dared to dream of. </p>
	<p>In this world were a house, a yard, siblings, warm meals, pet dogs, but best of all: love. Love was a foreign emotion to me. Deprived of me by my family and the entire world beyond the empathetic families. For weeks they treated me as their own genetic sequel. I never dared to say anything that would again tear love away from me. The families tolerated this for a while because an orphaned child not immediate in his will to speak is no surprise, no alarm. However, I never spoke. I never overcame whatever reasons they had: I never learned to, or was a foreigner, or my voice was the only thing that was mine and could not be taken away so I refused to endanger it. Some even took me to the hospital to see if I was mute. Of course I was not. When alone with the other children, they prodded me with any prodding objects at hand, usually sticks or tableware. But nothing came out of mouth, nothing but a drip or two of blood as my teeth pierced my lip. I bit so hard I wounded myself to mask emotions urging for vocal expression. At the sight of blood, the children screamed, announcing the event to the parents who came to my defense and swept the children away from me. I was alone then even in a house of love. I stayed sometimes weeks or even months until the children carried out a successful framing of me.  Staunch in my refusal to defend myself, they returned me to the train station, where I played out of my show again with the reward of another warm bed, and full house of empty love. This went on for years until I found my second passion, but for a price no human should endure.</p>
	<p>“Why did the families not take you to the authorities?”</p>
	<p>“Despite my accused offenses, they could not resist my pleads and pathetic begging to avoid a return to the orphanage.”</p>
	<p>“You lived in an orphanage?”</p>
	<p>“That is a time I do not wish to discuss.”</p>
	<p>He paused, a deep expiration, and continued.</p>
	<p>“My passion best expressed as psychological intrigue began with the bookcases of one family: the Gerlofss. They were less a family and more a couple who enjoyed the company of a pair of dogs. Frank was stout but not fat, with the physique of his bulldog Rooney. Louise was athletic and strong, with the physique of her German shepherd, also named Louise.</p> 
	<p>They bought me a dog of my own, a wispy stray with ragged hair and a constant snarl. He was given to me quite ill and died after only a few months due to a chronic illness. In those few months, he suffered all I have suffered as an outsider in this world. They handed the dog to me and said our misery would be our company. His illness brought new meaning to their words. They did not have pity on me, rather an unknown ulterior motive. I was given a sick dog as a friend and together we had to sleep on Tankred’s old, worn bed. Once at midday we were fed a can of dog food. They insisted that it had all the necessary ingredients for strong growing boy. Other times they said, “puppy.”</p>
	<p>They dehumanized me. They caninized me. I was given a collar and roped to the wall in the room. To use the bathroom I had to scratch at the door! However, the room I was in was an old study. The inimical Gerlofss did not value books or knowledge and so they let me stay there undisturbed in the study, which once belonged to Louise's father, a professor at the state university. There I found meaning for my intrigue and studied all the theories of the walls of books. I was there for years and read the library through twice. I gave myself a Masters level education without the toxic influences of professor’s forced interpretations. I spun new webs of intricate theories:  theories only able to be postulated by a brave brain that does not falter in face of potential failure or daunted by employment prospects. I had to unleash myself from this home to learn more.</p>
	<p>I, the dog, succumbed to one last act of dehumanization. I spread butter along the thick twine rope securing me to the study floor. I placed the rope in my mouth and bit, hard and strong, with an intensity and fervor demonstrating all the anger I had for my position and for the way I was treated— for my desperation to escape. I ground and tore until I felt my teeth would give, until my teeth bled. My teeth pressed with such pressure, as if fate was behind each set pushing them into an eternal love-filled bond. At once they met and rubbed out the few stubborn twines. By morning I was free. Without thinking I launched myself through the study window and out in the world.</p>
	<p>I hid in the basement of a famous bakery so busy I was never noticed. There I put all my theories to paper and soon under a pseudonym was famous. My books joined the nightstands of captains crossing the world, royalty and democratic leaders alike; the most academic of academics, everyone who had a curiosity of this world had also a curiosity for the contents of my book.</p>
	<p>Yet always alone I remained. I could not interact with other psychologists, with the academics who wanted to discuss the work. I new only to bite my lip until blood drove them away. It did. In turn, it drove me further into seclusion until I escaped through theatre. I learned to assemble a character, the character talking to you now, out of the pieces of many people I had listened to and studied throughout my many hours of silence. I am starring in a reality play here now and everyday of my melancholic life. I am the sum of all who I chose to mimic yet only a fragment of each. Please, for now on call me Samekh for I am now of many related ripples."</p>
	<p>“Samekh, true your life was difficult, but abandon the self-pity and begin living a life for something else, and not a life meant to compensate for dismal beginning. You have success now. Have your intellect’s conversations, and leave me to my tree.” 
“Fine I must be going then. I have more appreciative clients to help.” Dr. Samekh packed his leather satchel, climbed onto his bike and rode off.</p>
	<p>Peace for a moment.</p>
	<p>A high-pitched whistle of aural irritation sounded closer; the sound waves compressed tighter. The pain from its perception clenched the teeth and winced the eyes. The contrast to purposeful patterns and logic ached my ears, sensitive and attuned to only beauty. All one wanted was relief.</p>
	<p>This was Dante the boy of the devil with his whistle of public torture.</p>
	<p>"Are you ready to get out of that maggot hole, pop? Done with your pious act to amend your prior disgraceful life? No more risk of lighting bolts and hell fire from above. Oh, ow, it burns! Ah how shocking the lack of heavenly shock,” Dante laughed with himself and pretended to burn.</p>
	<p>"I told you not to come here unless you had a change of heart and black to red would need more than an alchemist to fix, so you cannot possibly be here for that. Please go back home. I need to eat and wish for no more guests, regretfully of my blood or not."
"Father you grow more distant each day. Your mind moves more distant from sanity as fast as a three-sailed ship from shore. Mikhail said you show signs of a certain poisoning from ergot and all that vile bread you eat., I think its Alzheimer's ready to melt your brain dead."</p>
	<p>"Oh, I applaud your tact Dante," I began with a sardonic smile, "it is not Alzheimer's rather wisdom. Mikhail is wrong. His mind is trapped in a capitalistic conception of organization for society. I operate in parallel with the clarity of a blank slate, and the density of an open source encyclopedia. I see that the meaning of life is not a game of acquisition meant to broaden an ego so far it stretches past the grave into subsequent generations. Rather life is a singularity event. We are birthed alone and die alone. So we must in an existential manner define all that falls between both ends of the continuum of eternal continuance in the name of the one who has bequeathed us this earth." I had diverged, changed tracks, become lost in philosophical speculation. I continued my speech but am unable to relate anymore of it.</p>
	<p>A snore so exaggerated it lost its humor pierced my rambling.</p>
	<p>I stopped.</p>
	<p>Dante spoke, "So this painting, where is it?"</p>
	<p>"Painting?"</p>
	<p>"The Bosch painting of yours that you lost. You said you had a clue, where it may be found."</p>
	<p>I must have mentioned it in my reverie. "Oh the Bosch, that piece I so coveted and fought to acquire, to own. Its consumption was so tasteful, and I think it should be left alone, wherever it may be." </p>
	<p>"You gave away all our wealth. I need this painting. I need to sell it. We are penniless.”</p>
	<p>“You are not penniless. I made all arrangements to have you cared for by the monastery. They will provide all you need, and nothing you should want.”</p>
	<p>“I do not want to be an orphan in care of some strange monks. After ruining our childhood, you could at least-“</p>
	<p>“You need a slap to your senses. Leave me here, alone!”</p>
	<p>Dante’s face transformed into his mother’s, my beloved wife’s, yet not the pleasant lively face of a woman in her prime. No a sick lifeless and pale form.</p>
	<p>“You killed your mother but I still loved you. I gave you everything, but neither her gross sacrifice nor mine is good enough for you. Leave, leave and never show your sordid soul here again!”</p>
	<p>Carnal emotion transpired on both sides. Unable to intellectually overcome the emotional death shot of his father, Dante, collapsed into salty-tears against the tree.</p>
	<p>“Dante.”</p>
	<p>“Dante please let me apologize. I am not I. I do not know what possesses me at the moment."</p>
	<p>I ripped some bread and scraped it along my makeshift wooden plate. The apricot spread clung to the yellow-green bread then continued."</p>
	<p>“But really I know nothing about the Bosch, so cannot reveal its location any easier than you can."</p>
	<p>"The painting is all you mentioned and talked about the last time we picked you up off the street down near the docks. You called it your favorite but lost son.”</p>
	<p>"I have no recollection of the location of the supposed lost Bosch painting. I have collected many paintings and cannot be expected to track the location of all of them. Can you leave me to my bread?"</p>
	<p>"Your poison? As you wish" Dante sat in frustration against the tree. He carved his initials unwilling to give up, but uncertain how to continue.</p>
	<p>I became again lost with my mind wrapped in on itself. I remained so until a sweet sound so unlike Dante yet in someway similar awoke me. An irritation on my side itched and burned.</p>
	<p>"Gabriel?" asked I with fragile awareness of the question.</p>
	<p>"Yes, your eldest son of a few minutes. I have come on request of Dante to bid you to please inform us, or at least I, further about this painting."</p>
	<p>"I am sorry but I know nothing."</p>
	<p>"You do but withhold it."</p>
	<p>"No, Gabriel, never could I do that to you, not not you, mein Engel."</p>
	<p>"And me father, what am I to you?" asked Dante with a sense of prescience.</p>
	<p>"No I already know. You loathe me. You consider me a nuisance. That which you had to suffer to have Gabriel. The balance of good and evil. A part of the balance of life and a necessity under the rules of this realm. Tell him to eat more bread Gabriel. Tell him to eat his poison and reveal to us his clue before he dies, if he would only be so kind. Through 17 years I accepted my father as an opaque apparition through the light-bends of a thick glass bottle. But no more. I am soon 18 with all my inheritance ashes. Ashes because of his own trust in an illusion.”</p>
	<p>As Dante spoke, the emotion erupted from deep within, and passed a point of no return. Dante entered frenzy; he tore at where I end and he begins. He shredded his fingers as he shredded the bark. He ripped the root up and entered my tree. He scurried this way, then that way. The alterations are immediate and his actions herald chaos. One might define his actions as a fury or a whirl. The energy battered my flesh with the ease of the accidental tapping of an electrical socket. Resistance broke in an instant and only the effects of its power evident. Weak from a sedentary lifestyle, he overpowered me with ease.</p>
	<p>"Eat. And then think clear you old man." He shoved the bread into my mouth. The broken opening let more light in. I saw the ergot clearer than ever before.</p>
	<p>Gabriel screamed in horror. He pulls Dante off pins him onto the ground effortlessly. Satisfied with the feeding, Dante surrenders without further fight.</p>
	<p>I murmur inaudibly. The shock of sudden stress has driven my addled mind into a disconnected state. My eyes close and open and in the dirt I scratch a word. I am prone babbling scratching and drooling. Tremors punctuate my murmurs.
Gabriel looks on in horror and bewilderment.</p>
	<p>Dante smirks and creeps closer.</p>
	<p>"Now that is what I want you old drunk. Scratch it out so I never have to return and feel compelled to pity again."</p>
	<p>I scratched out the name of painting. </p>
	<p>Dante reined his rage and studied the scratching, then wiped before Gabriel could read it.</p>
	<p><em>The Temptation of St Anthony</em> said my ill and runic script.</p>
	<p>At once Dante escaped the tree while Gabriel kneeled and coddled me, his elder succumbed to being his minor. </p>
	<p>I woke in Gabriel's arms. He was asleep. Moonlight shone through the fist hole of my door. Gabriel awoke with slow eyes, hesitant before the world.</p>
	<p>"Gab…Gabriel"</p>
	<p>"Yes, Father."</p>
	<p>"I am sorry. I remember the evening like one remembers a nightmare."</p>
	<p>"It is better that way. Do you remember the painting?"</p>
	<p>“Painting? Yes I remember it. What did you need to know?”</p>
	<p>“I need the name. You scratched out the name of the painting in the mud, but Dante erased it.”</p>
	<p>"I can only remember that I desperately need that painting Gabriel, please find it. Help your brother and leave me to my tree.”</p>
	<p>"No, Father, you will not stay here. You will come with me back home, and end this charade."</p>
	<p>"I cannot. You have not yet guessed my act."</p>
	<p>"What is your act?"</p>
	<p>"I do not know.</p>
	<p>"I am trying to help, not decode a puzzle."</p>
	<p>"But that is it Gabriel! I am decoding a puzzle. My last years are an uncharted, unexplored self-aware puzzle. I need help solving it. That painting must mean something. I plead you to aid your brother in a search."</p>
	<p>"Like the woman meant something? You must leave this tree and get some help.”</p>
	<p>“Help, yes help your brother.”</p>
	<p>“No you need help.”</p>
	<p>“Yes, yes I do. I need that painting. I need help decoding this puzzle and that painting is surely the first step. Will you help me? Will you help your brother?”</p>
	<p>“No I don’t see how I can. Dante hates me, almost equal as he hates you.”</p>
	<p>"You must overcome that and join him."</p>
	<p>"No. I just cannot. If I search, I will search alone. If this will help and get you out this tree then I will do it. I must go."</p>
	<p>"Gabriel you were always the better son, but Dante is an untamed soul. Be careful.”</p>
	<p>“No more bread,” replied Gabriel as he departed.</p>
	<p>Ease fell upon me as my brain nestled into a return to sleep. The seizures came now disguised as dreams. The ergot and the cancers weakened me everyday. I needed to find strength.</p></div>

    Dr. Samekh returned with a woman, a familiar face, Martina Bauer. Their voices expressed turbulence of argument, but too far way to hear until upon my
    tree, Martina said the final word and hurried away, “Your wit oft pricks the veneer of society, Samekh, but that wit pricks oft also your friends."
</p>
<p>
    Curious I asked, “What was that about?”
</p>
<p>
    “Such a smart girl, but muddles her magnificent mind in religion. She acts like those poor and uneducated, susceptible to command and myopia. Her ideas are
    flotadorian.”
</p>
<p>
    “Do you not hold any beliefs Samekh? I find solace in the idea of a designer, of an afterlife through an eternal soul, of something greater than myself,
    beyond this stale existence. The reassurance of the sheer fleeting essence of the terrors of nature, of the cruelty of a life defined by omnipresence of
    death.”
</p>
<p>
    “As all innately believe, yet life cannot be so easy, the product of infantile intuitions. A baby can recognize the pattern of lines that comprise a face,
    its innate. But the pattern-finding mind is overzealous, seeing patterns where they do not exist. These intuitions are only a simple solace. Opiate to the
    masses, Marx said, though I do not believe that all religions are opiates. Many offer lifelong terror and worry over the slightest deviation, or are
    concerned with the absolute mundane such as being buried with impractical worldly possessions without ever addressing the quintessential question of
    existence. But I offer answer in the potential of science, which does not punish for wrong assumptions and always remains up to date. In science, we are
    the product of randomness, of pressure and time, not of a merging of soul and body. Your religious soul is just a confusion of the connection between mind
    and body. Consciousness, that which encompasses all our memories, hopes, dreams, wants and needs, all of our mental life, is firmly rooted in the neural
    processes biology. You found a pattern of a designer where there is none and that pattern matches the constructs of your culture as the Hindu god matches
    their culture. The physicalist gaps filled by nonphysicalist agents to complete a more simple understanding of the world at the expense of truth, a
    frightening truth that is we will never know answer to the quintessential question.”
</p>
<p>
    “But this sense of a soul feels right. My brain is the tool of my existence, but separate from I. I tell my brain what to do, and it does it. <em>I</em> am
    my eternal soul. ”
</p>
<p>
    “The eternal <em>I</em> is only because you fear death, which leaves you susceptible to a dire hope for an immorality, an immortality where the I
    continues. But this all the result of infantile intuitions of grand delusion that leads to a notion of two separate worlds, one of us, of <em>I</em>, and
    one of all that is <em>not I,</em> physical objects. The physical is predictable, the psychological random. This is fundamental to human thought and
    arises in babies of religious families or not. If fundamental then, how can it be not true? I here have escaped the fundamentalism, thus it cannot be true.
    Just because something is natural does not mean its right. Do you succumb to all natural urges? No. It requires only a little work to escape. From here we
    are led to believe that humans, a petty species on an insignificant planet in a galaxy far removed from the center of anything other than our own
    delusions, will live on a place reflective of our insignificant lives. That heaven, hell or another parallel world—described with such richness of its
    cultural context as a respite from an industrious existence—is our end goal. It’s not. Far more difficult to reconcile is the finality of existence.
    Finality the brain cannot comprehend. Its not you, its your biology. Here I offer a key to a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate the key but fear the fear of facing the unknown. And while I have no desire to make false claims, I still want to believe and find a place
    for science among my beliefs, but do not ascribe all to science. Science proposes as ridiculous of a solution to our origin as any religion. From where
    does it all come from? How could the genius of this tree be by chance? To respire, a tall tree lowers its internal pressure tens of times below that of the
    earth’s by evaporating water through nanoscale pores, sucking it up over 100 meters in a state where it should boil but yet does not, because the xylem
    tubes carrying the water contain no air bubbles, they never have. And all of this is done to capture a few mere molecules of carbon dioxide.”
</p>
<p>
    “A tree is magnificent but cannot time be your god? Again you fall victim to shortsightedness. Questions of what and when and who are limited by our
intelligence and restriction to three dimensions. Like Flatlanders, our physical limitations prevent us from seeing the complete picture.    <em>From what?</em> First we need an answer for what, “what” is. <em>From when?</em> Time is derivative of the presence and absence of light coupled with
    mortality. <em>From who?</em> Inherently we are programmed to ascribe agency to the complex, and so naturally ascribe a creator to the brilliant inventor
    of science. We see an intricate web but cannot conceive of the spider. Agency, always detected, is convenient in the leisure of storytelling, where a tree
    can emote or a sheep make plans; it allows clever immersion and suspension of disbelief but in the end betrays us in higher-thought. We cannot comprehend
    the near infinite probabilities of it rising from nothing. We find gods in toast and wall drains. We find succubae in the shadows and signals in static. We
    are the fault of our incredibly effective and efficient pattern finder. We are wired to expect human characteristics in objects and events, which
    precipitates animism and from that fault, all religions emerge.”
</p>
<p>
    “Is saying we will never know not itself a superficial answer?
</p>
<p>
    “We, humans, will one day know if we can survive the quarrels caused by our propensity to find patterns, but we, you and I, will not know. Our
    consciousness will depart with our biology long before we reach that pinnacle of existence.”
</p>
<p>
    “Does that not frighten you, the fear of the unknown?”
</p>
<p>
    “Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear, and only a liar claims otherwise. As Dostoevsky said, “Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people
    fear most." I fear it as much you, but find dignity in facing it without consolation, and see your monkish existence as a surrender and coward’s effort to
    staunch the fear.”
</p>
<p>
    “I find the monks to be quite welcoming and hospitable.”
</p>
<p>
    “Provided you do not retake your donation, or violate one of their norms. They have incurred the painful initiation of losing forever their freedom. They
    dress the same, act the same, eat the same, speak the same, sing the same, worship the same not for orthopraxy, that clever guise of persuasion, but to
    maintain an in-group or fraternity of group solidarity. A brotherhood predicated on internalized false notions of genetic relatedness. Violate the norms
    and you will be banished, exiled away from the hospitality they preach.”
</p>
<p>
    “The monks would never be so harsh.”
</p>
<p>
    “One could find out, but not an experiment I wish to undertake. I envy your position of adamant belief. My torturous questioning of every tradition, of
    every belief, of every truth and thought is tiring. I fear sleep because I fear my undistracted mind.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will pray for you Samekh, that the peace I seek, you may also seek.”
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate it in my heart even if my head finds it futile.”
</p>
<p>
    “You are welcome.”
</p>
<p>
    I have another appointment with a client now and must not keep him waiting. He is a renowned neuroscientist and author struggling with the tragic death of
    his first pet.
</p>
<p>
    “I will pray for him as well. Goodbye Samekh.”
</p>
<p>
    “Until we meet again” replied Samekh as I heard him stand and depart.
</p>
<p>
    Samekh had never been so lucid or contemplative. He had shown an unknown side of his personality. I wonder what other sides he concealed.

    Burnt candle wax, autumn is here. An acrid air of burning wood, the autumnal chill fog infects every crevice of the cobbled town. Candles burn early now
    and earlier each day. The burnt wax wafts — so nostalgic, it's the winter's allure.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel rides through town and the houses blur on his periphery as perception bends at a constant value dependent on speed.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel clops through to the edge of this town (the abstract boundary realized by the amiable roots of the first Pyfn Forest trees). The town stretches
    below like grey blight over the craggy valley. The harsh artificial lights blind the stars. Gabriel turns his back.
</p>
<p>
    Before him is a cathedral of forest. Trees so tall, in such planned splendor that their dense branches sprout late and bend into an esoteric <em>centréal</em>. The
    ground is a carpet of moss. The air dense like the trees hovers as a cloud. Light reflects off of the cloud and obfuscation is born. He reads a sign at the
    forest's edge, “Ich sehe nicht mehr den Wald vor lauten Gebäuden.”

    Had the filial foe returned?
</p>
<p>
    The unsolicited aural aggravation invaded my ecclesiastical writings. I snapped up out of my straw bed and yelled in drowned retort at the grinding and
    shearing of the controlled explosions of a gas chainsaw. I felt impulse to beat the walls of the tree but in a melodramatic surrender fell to the ground,
    fists open now on ears, and yelling.
</p>
<p>
    The outside industry subsided.
</p>
<p>
    I poked my head out the opening to see a statue mid-construction. The shape was familiar and at initial glance I could not place it. I could only feel an
    anxious urgency, a fluttering gut one experiences when the known is a blurred image on the horizon that all to slowly comes into focus. The shape was in
    fact me. Some men—well traveled in appearance— had carved my likeness into a nearby tree.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me,” I called out, “Why have you done this?”
</p>
<p>
    “It is a memorial to honor you, Sir, in honor of your donation.”
</p>
<p>
    “A Memorial? Ridiculous! The engorged meaning we endow death only perpetuates a natural fear. Doctors ignorantly prevent this passing that frees us of the
    irrational fear of death. They are too determined to defeat that which should never be defeated, that which defines our lives. Oh, how glorious it is to be
    unfettered by a need for food, for water, from the temptations of alcohol, boredom and phantom females of which I was plagued throughout my mortal years.
    To be free from an average of 70 years leaning as far away from the end of continuum as possible, from death. They try to reverse the clock but it cannot
    be done and should not be done. Welcome the picturesque end! I can see the picture painted in my visual cortex now transcribed into language all through
    the marvelous communication networks of the human brain, the highest art in existence and an art so often undervalued; the seamless automation of the
    computations murdered for trivial matters. A brain, now that would make a statue! Do you know about the clock?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes we know about clocks.”
</p>
<p>
    “No <em>the</em> clock, the one that controls our lives.”
</p>
<p>
    “An abstract clock?”
</p>
<p>
    “Let me explain. So there exists a clock, ticking away with supreme stealth. Each tick is a second of my life, as with any clock a tick is a measurement,
    by seconds, of life. This clock does not follow a circular logic nor will it ever repeat the process. The clock’s operation is of strict biology, not human
    designed but evolutionary/intelligently designed (you decide your creed); the last tick it makes will occur at the last tick my heart makes. The clock and
    my body live as one. It defies the pervasiveness of the doctors’ magnetic probes, as it is more hypothetical than physical. No doubt it is consistent only
    though as far as thoughts, and feelings are. They must be generated but the true physicality of them is more virtual, fleeting renderings of the
    brain—collective results of complex neural networks. The clock is a product of thought and so, this clock is that way a product of neurons, which in
    esoterica decide the breadth of life, the purpose of death, and in death release a symphony, an ode to oxygen entitled <em>Cerebral Hypoxia</em>. In death
    the blood pressure drops, oxygen becomes scarce, and neurons, unable to maintain normal and functioning electric potentials, all fire in a domino effect, a
    surge of high voltage. The conscious experience is out of body, white light, and a final magnificence in death. The magnificent white light, is the picture
    of death. So forget the end; better to celebrate the beginning with grandiosity rather than make permanent the death. Who needs another aggrandized
    businessmen sculpted and placed as a public bird’s perch or as a forced idol of an overall dull deed? The only memorial needed is one that conveys the awful truth: there never is and will be any <em>great</em> men”
</p>
<p>
    “You are no ordinary man and your deeds are of high interest. All know this and the future should as well. They should know the former coherent you, not
    this beggar you.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am not a charismatic authority who invites unquestioning flattery and praise. I was a drunk and horrible father most of my life. Does the halo blind
    that fact? Are not memorials for the dead?
</p>
<p>
    “Your story has already spread throughout Halvemaen and engendered a fervent following. We must honor you with an idol!
</p>
<p>
    “Those who follow my story will never reach it. Its naive to think emulation of the successful will produce success. I will not allow you to preempt my
    death for profit!”
</p>
<p>
    “Profit, no, but the new church will of course accept tithes. Followers need to demonstrate their commitment.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I hope you learn as I learned what the true cost of great wealth is, and how responsibility is never considered. Merely those who become rich, become
    rich, whether they are the most fit for the task or not. They do not understand fully the system that granted their wealth. They only know that they are
    entitled to acquire it far beyond any level sufficient although not necessary for happiness. That psychotic psychologist who spends too much time at my
    tree surveyed my happiness at the onset of my madness and will survey it soon again. There will not be a change for the worse, I can assure you. My basic
    needs are met.”
</p>
<p>
    One of the sculptors replied, “I was poor once. I had $5 and the clothes on my back. Then while walking through the streets destitute, hopeless and
    starving I saw a $1 bill rolling along the ground. I mustered enough energy to capture it and was $1 richer but $10 happier. I used that $1 to earn myself
    $10 at the casino and my hopelessness replaced with jovial optimism. So, why say money cannot buy happiness? I can point out any number of poor souls in a
    similar situation whose lived were enriched with some unsought wealth.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is the happiness of the first bite, of the first taste of forbidden lips—all fleeting and vaporous.”
</p>
<p>
    “At what point does happiness obtain permanence? That $10 got me a suit, which got me my first job.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then are you happy?”
</p>
<p>
    “I have no debts, some savings, and a simple home.”
</p>
<p>
    “But are you happy?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes-“
</p>
<p>
    “What makes you so sure? I can have that pestering psychologist give you a survey. If your means are so wily as these, then you must be motivated by money
    and thoughts of more of it, not less. One cannot be incentivized for this work without money—Move this memorial to the other side of the tree. I never want
    to see it. And any ceremony for it will be accompanied by my contempt. This is your one chance at life and you chose a path treaded into a valley.”
</p>
<p>
    I closed the porthole and felt trembling or so I thought. The trembles were at the edge of perceptibility. They came from inside the expansive Pyfn forest,
    where trees were born.</p> 			</div>

			<div id="pyfnborn_content" style="display:none">
<p>
    At the plant's first sprouting, and millennia following, the fresh green flesh was porcelain, so weak and vulnerable. All the plants of the entire world
    were so. And it was also so that a passing foot could end in utmost tragedy life of once great promise.
</p>
<p>
    Until one day, in an area on the outskirts of town, but once the middle of a formidable fortress of foliage, a tree bit back. Not so much did it bite in the
    offensive, rather it bit back via its defensive. The tiny plant popped back up. From a foot asunder it returned immediately to being taut and even a
    hair-widths taller. This little plant had defied millennia, had defied all that came before it. The plant defied its culture.
</p>
<p>
    A trampling herd of clumsy steps continued to parade over the tiny act of defiance in an unwitting attempt to return nature to normal, to quell the 5-inch
    defiance, to pacify it with passive aggression, for this herd had no conscience intention of it’s trampling—it is simply how things transpired in these
    times. Yggdrasil endured and grew tall. The sprout became a plant became a small tree. The nomad's machetes swung into Yggdrasil with a determined
    violence, but Yggdrasil bent absorbing the force, then returned the force from whence it came with a lash forward, and at the mark of machete attack
    Yggdrasil's skin thickened. Every machete's scathe was a hair-widths of improved thickness. The once supple skin dried, cracked, and hardened into a
    callous body of bark, as each scar of its bark was enclosed in a thick shield. The bark was a ferocious instrument of protection. The thickened, sheathed
    frontal cortex at once advanced the tree into modernity. Other frail thin-skinned trees fell to Yggdrasil's roots, and with a little help from its
    symbiotic friends absorbed the frail trees into its magnificence.
</p>
<p>
    A forest is an organism, where a series of symbiotic relationships come to define the forest as one interdependent organism. All are interconnected in a
    dense biological network characterized by a shared root system or via the benefit or detriment of shade and sun. The proliferate <a href="http://tolweb.org/Basidiomycota"><em>Basidiomycota</em></a> of the
    kingdom of <a href="http://tolweb.org/Fungi/2377"><em>Dikarya</em></a> served Yggdrasil. The fallen tress sustained Basidiomycota, which absorbed them and recycled the waste into Yggdrasil. From the anguish
    of the languish in death, the fallen tress allowed Yggdrasil to flourish and the kingdom of Dikarya to thrive.
</p>
<p>
    The small act of Yggdrasil’s defiance was a catalyst for the entire forest and the world's trees. Yggdrasil was pulled upwards into an insignificant bump
    on the earth's topography, yet the perception from earth was a steeple into the heavens. The massive leaves were gluttons on the trunk's behalf. The forest
    fell evermore to its knees in support of Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil's seedlings fed off the inferiority of death. They grew with the thick skin of their father
    and also survived to seed, so they were fit. The entire forest soon stemmed from Yggdrasil, which had become the dendrological heart of the world. The
    features of Yggdrasil both peculiar and advantageous had been pumped throughout the world, wrapped the world in the veins of barked trees and completed the
    circulation on which Yggdrasil had embarked. At the apex has the tree remained with every year incredible gains in size, though its leaves have long
    receded, Yggdrasil still stands surmount.
</p>
<p>
    The cycle of life is a brilliance thus unchallenged. Our linear artificial systems of human design pale into insignificance. The paving of earth with
    permanence that a tiny seed can in time split, is but one example of the disproportionate intelligence of nature and man. When the paved earth begins to
    breathe, then perhaps we can say we nicked the bark of nature.

    Dante struggled through the thick brush at the forests entrance. The air was refreshing. He forgot its vitality.
</p>
<p>
    At Pfyn’s entrance, the dwarfish arborescent grove of bergföhre trees set upon and strangled the littered boulders. Past the boulders, where Dante now
    trekked in twilight, bunched columns of overgrown Fichte and Tanne like a quiver of a thousand arrows. Their tips reached forty meters.
</p>
<p>
    He took careful steps in endearing disbelief. Dante treaded Flotador, a land of water plants so dense and entangled they allow boots to make an
    imperceptible impression into the large swampy lake. The only living creatures in this part of the forest were serpent-like <em>schwimmer</em>, a water-loving snake
    that squeeze their cell-width thin bodies through the narrowest of crevices. Every step Dante prepared for a desperate swim, but never fell in. He ran. He
    jumped. Never more than a few pictometers deep did the plants allow his depression. His disbelief faded into expectance.
</p>
<p>
    The land of water and plant was flat, calm, and enchanted for its qualities promoted fantastical thoughts that preyed upon well-developed imaginations. The
    land was far more magical than magical describes and far more enchanted than any tale of a brother Grimm for this land was sourced from dreams of Dante’s,
    a near limitless canvas bounded only by conceptual extents of a 3-D entrenched, teenage mind.
</p>
<p>
    The compact fichte and tanne tightly wound at the top pushed out all light, all of the visible electromagnetic radiation the brain processed into color,
    into sight—that neural invention. Eternal shadows expelled all life but the <em>schwimmer</em>; a dearth of life meant silence.
</p>
<p>
    Dante felt nothing, heard nothing and smelled nothing; the dense but invisible air arrested all smells and sounds. Even a scream from mouth to ear never
    completed its journey. As a result, the void of sensory information tricked his novice pons—a gatekeeper brain stem region responsible for maintaining
    respiration and relaying all sensory activity—into the electrical processing of sleep. In sleep, the pons relays sensory information, although there is
    only random electrical noise to "sense." The information is confounding, nonsense; creative to a fault. Yet it pulses through and mixes with memories from
    the hippocampus.
</p>
<p>
    This is a part of the complex conversations of the nightly memory sort in sleep. The higher regions of the brain in the neocortex, desperate to see a
    pattern in the mix of sensory noise and memories, attempt to construct them into a cohesive story. So, the cute girl at the checkout becomes a passenger on
    a decades past drive to the beach, which turns out to be the grocery store morphing into school and at this point the girl vanishes as the dreams’ whims
    turns like a fire log from solid wood to wisps of wood smoke; their plausibility so fragile and meandering that the events are vanishing before ever
    becoming substantial.
</p>
<p>
    Dante's mind abhorring vacancy resonated with this chaos of self-generated noise. As in dreaming, the waking conscious mind of Dante drifted through lucid
    retellings of the day. The memories mixed with the indiscriminate sensory information from the pons, thus clogging the conscience with input—the ale of
    brains brew in dreams.
</p>
<p>
    A satellite passing above Flotador would see nothing; it has no dreams. Flotador emerged as a unique creation of Dante’s mind, fabricating all that filled
    his reality beyond the fabric of plants and water.
</p>
<p>
    To the right a figure of a vicious dog lurks—it is a nightmare on the hunt. Dante does not see it, not immediately. Recognition comes slowly as attention
    to one stream among thousands, as the focus on a single brush stroke upon a masterpiece.
</p>
<p>
    The figure lurks but instinct drives it into stalking and then pursuit.
</p>
<p>
    Dante turns and sees it. He runs. The nightmare runs. His dreams develop a sense of urgency. The wide flat surface of Flotador grows peripheral edges and
    narrows.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare dashes out from the parallel pursuit and settles into a steady chase.
</p>
<p>
    The surface becomes less flat, more obscured.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare gains.
</p>
<p>
    Dusk sets in or a dusk of memories past.
</p>
<p>
    The pons—an elementary brain region–cannot tell reality from dream. It raises respiration and his eyes blink fast. Open. Closed. Op-clo-en-sed.
</p>
<p>
    This is Rapid Eye Movement sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s toes curl in, trying to grab the ground through his boots.
</p>
<p>
    The world becomes fantastical as dreams flood conscience to fend off nightmare.
</p>
<p>
    For a few seconds nightmare is obscured by a kinetic wave of memories.
</p>
<p>
    His father.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest.
</p>
<p>
    His dog Pushkin.
</p>
<p>
    His childhood room.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest.
</p>
<p>
    His mother. Her schockolade eyes. Her fair skin. Her locks of dripping caramel.
</p>
<p>
    The waves of images are connected like frames of film.
</p>
<p>
    A single frame of the nightmare seeps in.
</p>
<p>
    He sees the banality of days past. He sees the poor he could not consciously place seeing. His non-conscious memory had spilled into his conscious. He was
    running now, not in a race but driven by the propulsion of his beating heart throwing him forwards with every beat.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in the forest?
</p>
<p>
    The conscious experience of the chaotic dreams cuts before he can consider it.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel takes his first slash at the forest bred bark and tree. He follows the nomads. Behind him the trees immediately thicken and the dense brush at the
    forests end strengthens. As twins, their dreams were complimentary, and so as twins, were Gabriel and Dante but a few who could complete such a quest in
    company, and not alone.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare is a diamond-encrusted wolf’s silhouette. The teeth gleam with the gluttony of pointed engagement rings.
</p>
<p>
    Dante glances back and glimpses his gleaming fate.
</p>
<p>
    Narrows of the forest narrow. His shoulders will be pinched before nightmare comes.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare nips his heel.
</p>
<p>
    A frame of his mother lying in a bed covered in red. She looks frail, lifeless and gaunt.
</p>
<p>
    Images Dante had never seen.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare nips again.
</p>
<p>
    His mother is agonizing. Doctors surround her. At the end of the bed her feet twitch and push into the mattress as Dante's pushes his feet harder into the
    ground.
</p>
<p>
    The diamonds shred his pants and nick his calf.
</p>
<p>
    A frame of his mother appears with gray eyes, gray skin, all the life filtered out.
</p>
<p>
    His breath comes with desperate suction. Each one a gift.
</p>
<p>
    His side is filled with needles. He cannot outrun it.
</p>
<p>
    The forest narrows enclose.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare’s diamonds scratch his leg.
</p>
<p>
    He kicks his battered leg back in fearful defense.
</p>
<p>
    A funeral for his mother. His father is absent. Then more images flood and flood as his heart pumps life out of his leg. Nightmare nips and bites and
    scratches.
</p>
<p>
    The images excite him, torture him, and he cannot place them. Has he never seen them?
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare leaps, mouth open.
</p>
<p>
    The narrows brush his shoulders then pinch them.
</p>
<p>
    He slows.
</p>
<p>
    Nightmare eviscerates Dante through the back, through the gut.
</p>
<p>
    The forest narrows crush him shoulder to shoulder. Snaps sound.
</p>
<p>
    White light flashes. Overexcitement perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    All that stands are Beech trees.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel moves forward with deliberate measured steps weary of a forest that closes out his entrance. The light disappears. He digs into his sack for his
    candle. Night has come so soon this evening. He lights the candle and raises it. The canopy above is dense but the floor beneath by the bases of the grand
    trees is sparse. Few living things can survive the purging of light.. Gabriel continues walking until he meets a stream of water black to his darkened eyes
    but blue and refreshing to his candle's light. The blue puddle draws Gabriel to its surface. He blows out the candle and bends low to the water. He cups his
    hand and scoops the water to his mouth. He did not realize how thirsty he had been and shovels scoopful after scoopful of water into his dry mouth. He
    splashes his face, wipes it mostly dry with his sleeve and then stands back up. He reaches for his candle but hesitates.
</p>
<p>
    Lights appear in the distance.
</p>
<p>
    Have his dreams already begun? It cannot be. He still senses the cold of the water.
</p>
<p>
    He flicks a match and lights his candle. The distant lights become closer, and closer, approaching Gabriel with haste.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel blows out the candle and stuffs it into his sack as he creeps along the stream to a narrow turn and leaps across, towards the lights. He crouches
    down behind a fallen giant of the forest, now alive with a life-passed. The lights are almost upon him. “Who could have lights in this deserted forest?” he
    wonders. He never knew any humans to live here. The only life he knew of were <em>weisswölfe</em>—a large white wolf known for its brilliant coats and elusiveness.
    They were harmless unless provoked, but finding one to provoke was a difficult task. He had never seen one and still had a doubt of their existence. They
    were probably another story of his Father’s to impede adventure, though there was a far more dangerous force in this forest than the <em>weisswölfe</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Light—diffused across the stream—showed a distortion of a man. The unsteady water bent the light creating a monster. Gabriel stopped breathing. He pressed
    his back into tree and lowered his end. The lights moved forward and a large orange boot came down over the log. Then another boot fell. They belonged to a
    villager, who was dressed as a hiker but had three extra arms each protruding with a bright lamp at its tip. His coverings were a patchwork of amateur
    tailoring fashioned from burlap and stained with the organic flavor of the forest. All the villager wore had a thin layer of ingrained dirt. The villager
    was covered, even his face in cloth and burlap. On his back he worse a burlap sack painted in yellow-reds to excite and disturb the goal of his hunts. His
    pants were an indiscriminate hide, beige from sun and forest. His coat was a bright white, a beacon of destruction and despair. He wore the skin of a
    <em>weisswölfe</em>. Heads of steeds, of sheep, or all manner of animal adorned his cloth and from these many heads emerged an image of an allegorical Giuseppe
    Arcimboldo painting, disturbing but surreal.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The light arms coiled robotic, and moved with a fluid slither through the air like three silver cobras dancing to the up and downs, the push and pulls of a
    charmer’s flute. Solar panels adorned the battery pack and yet still harkened a time of great exploration. The trilight suit, familiar to Gabriel, was the
    uniform of supposed <em>weisswölfe</em> poachers. Although, this rudimentary version appeared to have risen from the junk pile of two overzealous amateurs after
    some quick money.
</p>
<p>
    Expert Poachers never left their vehicles to go on foot. Instead they drove through the forest in their stealthy armored vehicles and shot the wolves from
    behind small slits in the armor that protected their luxury seating and entitled faces. The wolves though harmless were rendered menaces and beasts by the
    propaganda of the environmentally negligent and money-focused interests of the poachers. The impetuous savages lusted only for the brilliant white coats
    whose rarity demanded high prices. Their practices though unsustainable bothered not their uneducated minds, only focused meeting their present suspect
    “needs.” Needs to support themselves or the ever-pathetic excuse of supporting family, but a family they created and therein have revealed only themselves
    as the true cause of their problems.
</p>
<p>
    His coils bent and searched. They purged the darkness as he splashed through the stream. Contaminated yellow light, the tint of ergot, infected the land
    with each flex of coil.
</p>
<p>
    He had a lure on his backpack consisting of a toxic fake rabbit connected to large rope, which was a common tool of the <em>weisswölfe</em> poacher. The poachers
    set these out for the wolves, who eagerly pounced and crushed the rabbit in their jaws. The wolf’s teeth punctured the fragile shell of the toxic pouch
    stuffed into the rabbit. Toxins locked the jaw and caused momentary paralysis, just enough time for two-handed axe to fall on the defenseless wolf’s neck.
    But this was the primitive way, the dangerous way done by amateurs now. The toxin was no longer produced and amateurs lent themselves to being amateur
    chemists as well, with a risk that the toxin would fail, or have adverse effects. And an angered <em>weisswölfe</em> sees no end to its fury without bloodshed. This
    particular amateur had a bloodied axe on his back, and all four limbs.
</p>
<p>
    “Yelp!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was startled and yelped too. His position was compromised but he stayed frozen.
</p>
<p>
    The lights jolted backwards searching. They missed Gabriel. Then they turned back. The poacher stood on the streams edge and yelled into his arms.
</p>
<p>
    “That is it. This beast isn’t worth the scare. I ain’t havin’ no mamma wolf on my tail efter ‘er baby.”
</p>
<p>
    He turns and Gabriel sees the poacher with a small <em>weisswölfechen</em> in his arms and at this rate perhaps one of the last one to be born of the once pervasive
    population.
</p>
<p>
    The poacher holds a knife up to the wolf’s throat.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel gasps, “No!”
</p>
<p>
    The poacher turned around searching for the gasp and called out, “Who is there? Come out!”
</p>
<p>
    The lights showed Gabriel. He tried to block the most intense beams with a flat hand and squinting eyes. A small white <em>weisswölfechen</em> squirmed in the
    poachers’ arms.
</p>
<p>
    “Stand up, boy!”
</p>
<p>
    “I am no boy!” Gabriel stood up as tall as he could manage.
</p>
<p>
    “What are you doing in this forest, all alone?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m not alone. I’m with my father.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh sure, sure, your father. And where is he?”
</p>
<p>
    “He's, uh, gathering some sticks for firewood out that way” and he pointed downstream.
</p>
<p>
    “Well then what are you and your father doing in the forest? In my territory? I worked out a deal with the other hunters and not a soul should be here.”
</p>
<p>
    “Were passing through, too poor to pay for security along the rubbish road. Please do not hurt that puppy.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will do with my wolves what I want, and have no qualms cutting this little ones neck for calling the whole pack upon me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Perhaps its only hungry. I will take it from you,” pleaded Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “No I cannot risk it. It has my scent now and will bring its whole pack on me if I'm ever within spitting distance of this forest again. I think it’a’be
    best if I kill it, and then I kill, you,” the pointed end of a gnarly knife confirmed the threat.
</p>
<p>
    “So, you killed its mother?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, Sir, I did and she was quite a beauty. She’ll fetch me my biggest prize yet.”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s disgusting. What you do disgusts me. These wolves should be preserved and respected not hunted for their coats with everything else going to
    waste.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, I’ve a family to feed, something ya know nuthin bout.”
</p>
<p>
    “That only illuminates irresponsibility. You were not forced to have family, thus they are no burden of anyone or any state, only your burden. And what do
    you plan to do when all the wolves are gone? Let your family starve and think even less of you?”
</p>
<p>
    “I will not take such disrespect from a boy. You come over here now so I can give you a slap like your father should have done when you was a kid.”
</p>
<p>
    “Your blood-stained hands will never touch me.”
</p>
<p>
    As Gabriel spoke the last few syllables, he launched out of the brush, pulled out his dagger and aimed the blunt handle at the poacher’s forehead— the
    sturdy butt of the dagger knocked the poacher out. Gabriel found violence so primitive. He excelled in its effective application but struggled with the
    dissonance of that fact congruent with his utter hate of the propensity of the dumb to engage it on impulse. Like these poachers, who act as survival
    automata, which view all other animals and people as exploitable barriers.
</p>
<p>
    He scooped up the puppy using his shirt careful to avoid spreading his scent, gave it some sausage from his bag and set it free across the stream. He left
    the poacher to seek penance from the wolves.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel tore off the poachers white coat to wear in honor of the wolf whose life now only meant this coat. Before he put it on, he dragged it through the
    mud and soaked to offset the bright white, an attractant for a vengeful pack.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel opened his bag and pulled out the sheep’s bladder of mulled wine. The spicy alcohol tingled his cheeks, tongue and throat then down into the
    stomach and throughout his entire body. He took out his mat made of swan feathers stuffed into a whale’s stomach, and unrolled it. The swan feathers were a
    soft island on the hard ground; the whale’s stomach ensured they were dry. He stretched out across the mat and shut his eyes. The old mulled wine was an
    anesthetic and he fell a deep slumber full of vivid dreams and no nightmares. Gabriel transitioned in a wine-inspired sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s sleep lasted a day or maybe a decade. Without any light or stars he could only guess. He felt rested and ready, not overslept or underslept and
    made to a quick start to his day. He switched the battery pack on and the lights came to a reluctant luminescence. The battery was low. He began with a
    steady jog. The lights would not endure another lightless day, so he must hurry. His candle would get him only a few hours and then he would accede to the
    whims of the darkness.
</p>
<p>
    A few hours passed and Gabriel again tired under the weight of the battery. The lights had already begun to dim without enough voltage to produce a
    substantial light. Gabriel switched the lights off and took the battery pack off. He pulled some coffee beans out of his bag. They crunched with a bite and
    splintered into every crevice of his teeth. The gritty beans would give him the motivation to catch up to Dante. He could not be much farther now.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stared into the abyss of black. Absence of light had a solemn tone, and unsettled one as the unknown unsettles, but also relaxed as the calm of
    emptiness can. He pondered if Nietzsche’s abyss was looking back at him. Were there poachers’ eyes on him in his masquerade? He had the battery pack but no
    other marks. An unsettling feeling began to overcome any calm, betrayed by his own rumination.
</p>
<p>
    He switched on the battery pack. No light. He switched it off and on. Again no light.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled out his candle. The dripping wax and fragile flame slowed him down. He hoped to yet intercept Dante.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel entered a slow jog. The candle flame struggled against the passing wind, and lit only a narrow patch ahead of him. The coffee beans lent him the
    adrenaline to be purposeful and attentive. His eyes had completely adjusted to their new lifestyle of discerning vibrating blurs of black and white.
</p>
<p>
    The candle, worthless in facing the winds of the abyss, extinguished. Gabriel now must travel the vast expanse in dark with great threat to his mind by his
    mind. The terrain declined in a slight grade down into the Stillfluss, an offshoot of the Rhein that meandered capriciously through the forest. Through the
    dark forest slithered a force of water with a breadth unparalleled and a depth holding some of the deepest biological secrets. Rumors, legends, and
    scientific hypotheses have been made about the origin and demeanor of creatures nestled beneath its depths. A peasant and a scientists alike would tell you
    fantastic stories of tree-sized fish without eyes. In place of sight, they play haunting sonar of drones and unnerving pitches to see with sound. Or the
    so-called Lucifer Lizard, which breathes microwaves that boil its prey with ease.
</p>
<p>
    Miles yet lay between Gabriel and the stream. He had been in a decline for a half-hour now. Gabriel worried Dante had tried to cross the Stillfluss without
    the help of a ferry tortoise. Another creature of the river very much confirmed to exist. The tortoises were as large as man, and some say as intelligent.
    They did now have the modern amenities one equated with an advanced society but material is subject to morality and the tortoise lived in a society of
    sharing, of ubiquitous peace, of utopia despite their unclothed shells and mud homes.
</p>
<p>
    A foot caught an unconscious body and Gabriel had found Dante. He fell forward, gravity yanking him down the steady slope into a confused roll.
</p>
<p>
    Lights!
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was blinded. The sudden flash had overwhelmed his rods and they shut-off in protest.
</p>
<p>
    His hearing, still acute from hours of visual deficiency, alerted him. More poachers were here and now pinched him from both sides.
</p>
<p>
    “I am no wolf my lords!” shouted Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, did ya hear that Peir. We’re lords now.”
</p>
<p>
    “I did hear and I say we punish this intruder as a lord would.”
</p>
<p>
    “Punish me for intrusion? But I am only a misguided peasant who means no dishonor to your lands.”
</p>
<p>
    “Cut his tongue out! Cut the bastard’s tongue out of that lyin’ mouth! No peasant dare enter these forests. You are intruding not only on our land but our
    livelihoods. You run like a train rumbling through our forest! Not a single wolf ll’be miles o’here. If yer travelin’, ye should be on the rubbish road!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel smirked reluctantly. He seemed on a path to violence only an animal was capable of. After all, he had evolved during a foraging lifestyle not far
    departed from the life of an animal.
</p>
<p>
    “Yelp” a sorry cry came from behind Gabriel. The orphaned <em>weisswölfechen</em> had followed Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “What was that? You have a pup in there. Are you trying to get everyone killed?”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t worry, I killed its mother and have taken this a prize. I. . .I can pay. I have not much, but will trade all I have for my freedom and direction
    from your lands.”
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t want a peasants pennies!”
</p>
<p>
    “Peir if he can pay, let him pay,” said the poacher under the dimmer light and with a whisper added, “we can take his meager life anyways. I reckon my boot
    would be enough.”
</p>
<p>
    His whisper was a yell to Gabriel’s overly sensitive ears.
</p>
<p>
    “How much ya got peasant?” blurted the brighter light.
</p>
<p>
    “I have 1 Geld and some 1/10 pieces”
</p>
<p>
    “1 Geld will save your foot”
</p>
<p>
    “Its all the metal I have in this world. I am banished from my home and now wander to a new home.”
</p>
<p>
    The brighter light approached him.
</p>
<p>
    “Hand it over!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel bent over and foraged in his pocket. The acting was a sufficient ruse to distract the poacher from his other hand now grasping his dagger. “He
    thrust the dagger into the bright light and heard it make its mark. At the same time, an elegance of glistening white, so powerful yet with majesty unfit
    of these backwoods poachers burst from the darkness and eviscerated the dimmer of the lights. The growls, and tearing of flesh that comprised violence were
    expected of this animal, having no higher functioning. The screams behind the dimmer light became muted by the flow of blood into the throat, which lay
    frayed and torn. The glistening <em>weisswölfe</em> vanished into the black. Gabriel, frozen in awe, could not even offer the <em>weisswölfe</em> a silent nod of
    appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel resourced the Poachers’ lights: one he wore and one he packed for Dante. Gabriel looked at his first kill, so different than the dummies in his
    father’s courtyard. The blood was liquid not straw and the smell already much worse than even a long day’s practice in the humid sunny air. He had taken
    life and a life deserving of no memorial than what rots here, and had no regrets for using the less blunt end of his dagger.
</p>
<p>
    He found the many variety of lives intriguing. His father had a life worthy of immortality in memorial, but others are hardly as lucky or some even more
    so. Some are given meaning that even a school child can recite, while others are never even given a life that allows them any idea of what life is. Birthed
    and then dead before a brain could grow to comprehend or remember that they existed. They breathed. They had heartbeats. They did not live.

			<div id="gamut_content" style="display:none">
<p>
    Gamut, a distinguished man aged like a good ale, wore a speckled beard of dark and light shades that wrapped around the back of his balding wrinkled head.
    Beneath a long nose with rounded nostrils stretched the neat beard like a triangle to the ovular jawline. His eyes were dark but kind, and his heart
    palpitated with excitement. He had returned to Halvemaen—the city of his formative years as an architect—to visit the first building he designed: a
    library called the Halvemaen Bibliothek.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gamut arrived at the location of the Halvemaen Bibliothek and believed himself lost. Absent were excited children, old men napping beneath half-read
    newspapers, intellectuals and their pseudo counterparts conversing over coffee —all his memories of the place reconsolidated into an unrealistic fiction.
    He wanted to blame the present and long for an idyllic past, but idyllic is and always will be a naïve fiction. The past was a present no better than the
    present.
</p>
<p>
    Before him decayed a forgotten structure that expressed the passage of time like Gamut’s worn face. Defaced boards replaced the ornate stained glass of the
    windows, and a missing roof subjected the insides to the maladies of the elements. Distraught, he neared the building trying to comprehend the disconnect
    between memory and reality, caressed the tired stone as one does the rigid body of a coffined loved one. New connections formed, but a piece of Gamut died.
    He retreated to one of the numerous pubs to crudely rewire his emotions.
</p>
<p>
    Gamut new better. He had left Halvemaen for the reasons that destroyed the library, which had become a prized memory now short-lived and swimming in
    alcohol. He had been driven away by the artistic constraints of building meretricious churches, redundant malls and foul-bricked pubs with substandard
    materials matching the vulgarity of their society. He had to slog through everyday, contending with an idealess manager, whom always demanded but never
    thought. At Gamut’s departure to the unknown of Terenverde, he left this note:
</p>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<em>
        I had not pleasure of working together, unless in precedent a man can derive in congruence both feelings of pleasure and immense pain, but immense pain
        is all I recall, absent all pleasure from pain. Repressed perhaps the pleasure lies, but distress is all that exists beyond repressed to my waking
        mind. I venture to a front unstressed, an accumulation anterior an abrupt avalanche, the avalanche my future foreseen. To prevent thus and play a trick
        with time, I submit this novel rhyme as my two weeks notice, notice and embrace, erase all trace from mind, for I just yet erased thine.
	</em>
	</p>
</div>
<p>
    He entered a full pub; it was another sports day. He found a seat at the bar, ordered a beer, but the seat was not his to take. That circle of space had
    been conquered in the name of Peir Gerlofs, a local poacher.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey old man, get out of my seat!” demanded the pugnacious poacher.
</p>
<p>
    “It was empty when I arrived, no drink or name had indicated it was taken. Besides, it’s the bar’s seat,” replied Gamut with the calm of self-control.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, smart ass, that’s my seat, these girls here were supposed to watch it for me,” Peir Gerlofs pointed to two female clones harboring not a single
    unique thought or idea among them.
</p>
<p>
    “And they failed at even that task. This is my seat now. Another will open up soon, I am sure. Or maybe you can pull one from a table. This is not an
    offense worthy of such hostility.”
</p>
<p>
    “No, this is MY seat so LEAVE or we can take this outside. I will not be disrespected in front of these girls!” Gerlofs shouted.
</p>
<p>
    Gamut remained stoic.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you even understand the words and thoughts you express? Why become so instantly stressed and angry for such trivialities as seats and honor? Honor is
    just a word, an invention, and only lingers out of pluralistic ignorance — everyone believes everyone else believes it exists. No reason then to invite
    violence for trifling matters such as the momentary owner of a seat.”
</p>
<p>
    “Or we can settle it here,” Peir threatened. .
</p>
<p>
    Gamut’s words fell on dumb ears, but he pressed on, “I admire your proactive display, your unhesitating will to impress a fearful reputation, but I am not
    here to challenge you or that fragile reputation. I am here to sit.”
</p>
<p>
    “You can sit on the floor,” said Peir as he gave Gamut a shove.
</p>
<p>
    “Your impulsivity blinds you to the reductio ad absurdum of your actions. Consider this. Your tough act is defense of your honor, which is presumed needed
    to impress a mate, derived from a presumed universal goal of winning the absolute best mate, that goal of winning the best mate derived from presumed
    pleasure of being with that mate, that conquering exhilarating pleasure derived from a rewards system, derived from chemical impulses, derived from an ion
    exchange. You see, all this anger and hostility is only a chemical exchange, so lets exchange chemicals, and not bloody fists. What are you drinking? I’ll
    buy you a drink.”
</p>
<p>
    Peir, lost at “your” reoriented at “buy you a drink,” could only say, “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
    The tense impasse disintegrated from challenge of dominance into a sign of friendship. Peir and Gamut cheersed two glasses of ale, and then Gamut left his
    seat and the pub to Peir Gerlofs.

</p>
<p>
    Spit rolled out over my lip and down my face. I discovered this afterwards, as my neurons of tactician conspired with the entirety of my brain in its brief
    fit of arrhythmia.
</p>
<p>
    Like a fireworks show mistimed to music, my brain fired and fired in a brilliant trembling asynchronous display.
</p>
<p>
    Slooowwwyyy ttthhe ttrrembles stopped.
</p>
<p>
    “Another seizure. You should see a doctor, a medical doctor,” said Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    He had witnessed the entire episode.
</p>
<p>
    I wiped the spit from my mouth, “I have.”
</p>
<p>
    “I said a medical doctor.”
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak have been educated the most esteemed of institutions.”
</p>
<p>
    “Intelligence and hard work does not rule out amorality. Aristotle taught me that one in his Ethics while I played dog to the unethical”
</p>
<p>
    “Aristotle must have also taught you then to be a magnanimous man, so please fetch me some water.”
</p>
<p>
    I sat up worried about my sons, and rubbed my patchwork beard. Perhaps stress had caused the seizure. They had not been gone long, but the visions during
    my seizure were frightening scenes of wolves, poachers and blood. Gabriel looked old. “Did they mean anything?” I wondered
</p>
<p>
    “Here you go, Dr. Allemanne.” A yellow-sleeved arm stretched into my tree, a cup of water at its end.
</p>
<p>
    “Th-Thank you!” I sipped the water.
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me more about Emywyn.”
</p>
<p>
    “No! I will not discuss her!” my anger sourced from a disinclination to humor the doctor.
</p>
<p>
    “Please, you must have had pleasant times. Think back for me.”
</p>
<p>
    I had no free will to stop the subconscious from retrieving memories, both visual and emotional of my wife. Only seconds afterwards was my conscious clued
    into its mischief.
</p>
<p>
    Nostalgia warmed my mind into a smile.
</p>
<p>
    “Emywyn and I met at university. She worked at the library, while I lived in the library. At the time, I was writing my thesis. I arrived at the library
    the moment it opened and left long after dark. Due to this routine I came to know the building’s deepest secrets and celebrated in its beautiful moments: a
    rare book discovered or young child creeping to a table with a stack of books nearly his same height.”
</p>
<p>
    Curiously, the self-concerned doctor had not yet interrupted me.
</p>
<p>
    “Precisely on the first Sunday of May, oh how I remember that day, a few weeks into this routine, I browsed the science-fiction section. Water fountain and
    bathroom breaks had already turned tiresome, so I stretched my white and grey matter among the farthest reaches of human creativity. From behind the dull
    colors of the extravagantly named books, shown two brown eyes, Emywyn eyes. A glacial smile formed across my face. A few hairs escaped their nest behind
    her ear and fell in front of her face. In a quick fluid motion, she replaced them. Her excitement of our mutual captivation embarrassed her and unsure how
    to respond she quickly continued placing books on the shelf as if nothing had happened.
</p>
<p>
    Yet something did. We both knew that.
</p>
<p>
    I followed her down the aisle, and into the next, awaiting another glance. But she was stubborn and ignored my obvious chase. So I turned to displacing
    books for her to reshelf. The long hours of study had quite incapacitated my social skills. I chose a systematic brute force approach seeking to repeat the
    process in hopes of similar results. Yet never would her eyes stray again into captivation. Aisle after aisle I waited patiently through the books.
    Finally, her stubbornness to recognize my presence gave way to frustration.
</p>
<p>
    “If you need help finding the correct book, please let someone on staff now. I do not have time to pick up after you like some child!’
</p>
<p>
    Now it was my turn to feel embarrassed. I retreated to my table, and gathered my things. No worthwhile study would have been completed that night.
</p>
<p>
    So a few weeks later, after avoiding the library, I had to return. My roommate was far too loud, drunk, and inconsiderate to tolerate any longer.
</p>
<p>
    As I sat at the table in the back, a curious book was dropped next me. While I perceived the book, and in the background began to process guesses as to why
    a book was dropped in that space at that time, my attention was focused on the final calculations of a difficult mathematical problem in front me. Once I
    completed the problem, the curious book slipped into conscious position, and no longer hummed beneath the surface. A few seconds this lasted, and enough to
    miss the girl, well the most of the girl. I caught her woolen legs rounding the corner of the shelves, and heard the squeak of a cart.
</p>
<p>
    In the book was a bookmark. I opened the book to a story of such obscurity that her vandalism may never be discovered. In the book was a scribbled note of
    letters and numbers separated with periods. She must have noticed my books on theoretical physics and logic, and now wanted to play host to a scavenger
    hunt. I obliged.
</p>
<p>
    I scribbled out the frantic telling’s of my calculating mind. Polybius Squares and Caesar Shifts, the Trimethius Tableau or the Vigenère Cipher. But the
    code was neither so complicated nor was it easy, but one devised by a librarian. I leaned back and breathed deeply to open my mind to its full creative
    potential. I stared into space. My visual memory cut off as I momentarily considered the enigmatic sequence.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly in front me, directly in front of me, there it was. The side of the book read a similar script of numbers and letters. The code was no code in the
    sense of needing cracked, rather a Dewey decimal assignment of a single book in the vast library.
</p>
<p>
    I snatched the note and ran off to the familiar aisles of 150.1952. Books on psychology resided at that Dewey decimal class.
</p>
<p>
    I rushed to the books aisle, searched out its discrete place, but the book was missing, a sudden end to this game thwarted by her absence of foresight.
    Someone must have borrowed the book.
</p>
<p>
    Then through the book’s empty residence, I saw her eyes staring at me, her mouth smiling, her face flushed.
</p>
<p>
    I leaned in and as our lips met with just a peck I smacked my head against the shelf, but a kiss soon followed after she hurried over to my row, giggling
    with delight.
</p>
<p>
    The missing book was Freud's <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em>. We spent the evening in that aisle discussing the book, our lives and in developing
    a mutual elicitation of addictive feelings reinforced by mutual presence, better known as falling in love.
</p>
<p>
    She wore red that day. Always, she wore red, as a personification of Goethe’s red which, “conveys an impression of gravity and dignity, and at the same
    time of grace and attractiveness”
</p>
<p>
    “And you married a few years later?” asked Samekh
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, and in just five years time I was a widower drunk with Faustian sons.”
</p>
<p>
    Up the walk came my peer, Mikhail, a man in his closing years with distinctive dress and demeanor. His expertly tailored suit shone extravagant against the
    background of the simple grey stoned church. He interrupted the conversation, for which I was relieved.
</p>
<p>
    “Good Afternoon, Mikhail, I am just having a discussion here with a Samekh. Why have you come?”
</p>
<p>
    “To coerce you from this tree and return to your family ”
</p>
<p>
    “I must be here to listen to Dr. Samekh who cannot afford to pay anyone to hear his problems.”
</p>
<p>
    The remembrance of my immense loss had depressed me into a foul mood.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me, I do very well for myself?” asserted Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail flipped a 1/100 geld out of his hand in front of Dr. Samekh, who snatched it from the dirt without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, Dr. Allemanne, please, end this ridiculous charade, and come see a real doctor, a medical doctor. He’s been my physician for years and will provide
    you the best health care in the world!”
</p>
<p>
    “I already tried,” commented Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t need anyone’s doctor,” I replied.
</p>
<p>
    “You only stay there because of that awful bread you are eating. The rotten bread is rotting your mind!”
</p>
<p>
    “The bread is the best in the region, from the renown Renomme!”
</p>
<p>
    “Renomme would have baked a rat if it passed close enough to his hand. Now, come up out of that hole. We’ll get you some medication and tomorrow I’ll send
    you to the tailor. Soon we can spend the afternoon drinking fine wines and chasing some young woman, like the old days.”
</p>
<p>
    “Everything I need is here in my hole.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about your sons? Or are they also not yours, and you were a father only in delirium?”
</p>
<p>
    “The sons are grown and no longer need their father.”
</p>
<p>
    “A son will always need a father. This is life, and one of luxury and excess comfort. Now you sit in filth in a tree a beggar.”
</p>
<p>
    “A beggar with a coin is richer than I, but only in earth. I’m rich in spirit.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, so we have a new prophet. And where is all your coin?” Mikhail questioned with an anxious curiosity.
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed, he is a prophet!” realized Samekh, “he has visions, and writes with religious fervor!”
</p>
<p>
    “Gave it away, I don’t need it here. Saved only a small sum to get my boys accustomed to living without me. But seems they have run off on naïve some
    mission to bring us all back together”
</p>
<p>
    “You just said you sent them. What do you mean? Where have you sent them?”
</p>
<p>
    “East”
</p>
<p>
    “No. . .” Mikhail paused, and then continued, “they’ll surely die in there. No one, not even this eccentric fool of a quack can survive the tortuous turns
    ones mind endures within the forest.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh oblivious to the comment, one that numbered in his or her life as a sand grain of sea, offered this, “He is right, Dr. Allemanne, the mind turns
    on itself in the manner of a schizophrenic or chronic depressive. Thoughts become conscious that drive and demand to end the conscious. Like a virus, the
    thoughts infect their host with such demanding and blind desire for dominance that it kills the host and itself.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is their chosen path.” I responded.
</p>
<p>
    “I wish I did not have to do this and apologize in advance. But this ends now. “
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail opened his mouth, but his clenched teeth kept the cigar in place. With gritted teeth he called to his driver a few hundred meters away, “Sven, come
    here and help me pull this fool out of this hole, he got himself stuck. Then we’re taking the car east today.”
</p>
<p>
    “I do not need to be rescued. I am in here in complete sanity,” I pleaded.
</p>
<p>
    “You will come out of that hole today and see my doctor once we find your sons.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sven come pull this doors open. He has it locked, but doubt that’s a problem for you.”
</p>
<p>
    Sven Nynkvist was a massive man, with an inverse relationship between his brain and brawn. He was dressed in a long woolen coat, navy blue. He had a hat,
    also blue, and a full, proud Viking beard reddened by Scandinavian genetics, which had also influenced his healthy girth and towering height. He always
    followed every minutiae order of Mikhail without even seeming capable of having an opinion on the matter. He would die— hundreds of him would die—yet no
    reader would ever feel empathy. Hans had blind loyalty, like a dog, but not even a half-smart dog will repeatedly bite its own tail.
</p>
<p>
    He squatted and tugged at the hinged root, reposed into pull of power. Dante had loosened the hinges that now strained under the weight of one Sven pounds.
</p>
<p>
    “Away from my opening. Do not touch my home.” I shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “You’re coming out of there right now. This ends today,” Mikhail demanded.
</p>
<p>
    “I’m a man of my own free will and separate existence, you have no right to remove me!”
</p>
<p>
    Then a sudden crashing, earth quaking sound erupted from within the tree, as Sven leaned back with all his weight, then fell backwards with a thick
    detached root in his lap.
</p>
<p>
    Light tore into the gaping hole of the tree. Sven stared in shock from his abrupt seat on the grass just outside the porthole.
</p>
<p>
    I seized, again, only a few hours recovery. I seized and thrashed.
</p>
<p>
    Sven froze.
</p>
<p>
    Across the cathedral lawn came Abbot Wilhelm, frantic and scolding, a fluttering of purple fabric.
</p>
<p>
    “Mikhail, I gave no permission to disturb Dr. Allemanne. We discussed this and you promises no more interference.”
</p>
<p>
    “But do you not see his sick and needs help.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t you see that he is in his under the care of the greatest doctor in the world, the inventor and designer of the flesh!”
</p>
<p>
    “That lets him suffer? He had another seizure and he may have hit is head. He needs medical attention. Sven, pull him out.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sven and Mikhail, you need to leave. Dr. Allemanne will be fine. This is only a test of his faith. I will have some of the monks tend to him.”
</p>
<p>
    Oblivious Sven, preoccupied Samekh and frustrated Mikhail departed my tree.
</p>
  <p>
  </p>
<p>
    Silence. The stillness ere dawn, all diurnal creatures await their waking, while the nocturnal never move on an audial plane.
</p>
<p>
    I breathed slowly.
</p>
<p>
    My pants were moist with the most unpleasant side effect of my seizures.
</p>
<p>
    I changed them in the dark.
</p>
<p>
    I tore off a piece of bread and ate.

<p>
    Seconds or years could have passed beneath the opaque canopy. Precise measurements required a reference point that could not exist on the stimuli
    impoverished forest floor.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel hoped for a short trip to the river, and hoisted Dante onto his shoulders. The memory of the forest map he had studied in Halvemaen was lossy, the
    finer details disregarded in process of capturing the larger picture. He remembered the general relative size of the tree groves, rivers breadth and
    meandering trail from Halvemaen down into the ravine home of the Stillfluss, but the distances were details lost.
</p>
<p>
    Rustles alerted him. He froze, all his attention diverted to his ears and the narrow band of light that fell upon the void.
</p>
<p>
    To his right another rustle, he lashed his light at the sound. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Louder now, closer, another rustle in front of him. He twisted his neck swiftly towards the front. The light followed.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle left.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle right.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    He had light; this could not be nightmare. It must be an actual danger of the cloaked forest.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle right.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    His throat fell into this stomach. Pupils dilated. Sweat pored out of his palms. Adrenalin spurted into his bloodstream. Sudden stress. Now is the time to
    fight, flight or freeze. He was frozen.
</p>
<p>
    Sweating.
</p>
<p>
    Heart racing
</p>
<p>
    Gulps.
</p>
<p>
    Then the <em>weisswölfe</em> barrels playfully into his chest.
</p>
<p>
    Euphoric relief as an intense stress response dissipated with as much conscious control as existed during it’s conjuring.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel laughed at the absurdity of the intense fear only moments ago. A soaking wet tongue rolled over Gabriel’s cheek. The sand paper texture playfully
    tantalized his facial nerves. He felt a mild itch of the knismesis tickling variety. Gabriel wrestled the <em>weisswölfe</em> off his chest, and gave him some
    reassuring rubs around the ears.
</p>
<p>
    Weighed down by the forlorn psychological burden of an ostensible perpetual trek, Gabriel struggles to raise Dante’s unconscious body onto his shoulders.
    With sweat and a single grand exertion he lifts Dante again on to his shoulder. Beneath his shoulders arose his shaky legs from the side of the muddy hill.
    The legs straightened then collapsed, Dante toppled over Gabriel's head onto the soft, moist ground, covered in leaves and botanical debris.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>weisswölfe</em> grasped Dante’s shirt and gave a communicative tug, then stared at Gabriel: an indication of the clever mind beneath the flesh-shredders,
    sensitive remote tracker and night vision of this biological killing machine—a look of intelligence beyond the reach of one’s immediate prejudices.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel laid Dante down and fastened a sled from the hemp mat and rope he had packed in Halvemaen. Gabriel tied one of end of the hemp mat to an improvised
    collar he had made for the <em>weisswölfe</em>. Together they pulled Dante into the void with a poacher’s light and the radiant eyes of the <em>weisswölfe</em> illuminating
    the path. Darkness drifted in and canceled the enlightened world black.
</p>
<p>
    With a careful smooth precision the wolf dragged Dante to the bottom of the hill but came to an abrupt stop.. In all directions, water moved in a slow
    southern silence. The weak lamp on his shoulder disappeared into the darkness before it reached the bank on the other side of the Stillfluss.
</p>
<p>
    Scattered across the surface of the water like stepping-stones, were rounded olive shells, the <em>Schildkroete</em>, or ferry tortoises, graced with a life in
    grateful impression. Once only hopeful imaginations of suspicious books, the fantasies of the Pyfn forest revealed to be true, and shaped the true meaning
    of wonder. Few humans dared enter here on foot, only a select few like Gabriel and the writers of books.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps this is where I belong, Gabriel thought. Not amidst artificial stone, steel and plastic, but within the confines of pure nature, like Thoreau and
    his pond, where no voice or hand can pollute, where one is not subject to the selfish decisions of those thousands who live around them in redundant
    revolting reflections of one another.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled the pelts off his back. He didn’t have a shovel, so he got down onto his knees and began digging with his hands, scattering the mud in a
    visceral search, as a desert man for water amidst intense drought. The <em>weisswölfe</em> joined him. The soft mud slid through Gabriel’s fingers as he formed a
    large hole. He hoped it was far enough from the bank to be protected from erosion. Together they made a large hole into which Gabriel placed the pelts of
    the poached <em>weisswölfe</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel leaned over the hole and whispered his condolences and vows of vengeance for such ugly and useless death. To take life for any reason other than to
    sustain life, Gabriel found despicable. The wolves were treated as objects on the path to mild wealth, their lives only worth as much as their pelts. Such
    tragedy.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>weisswölfe</em> howled a saddened shuttering tragic howl that vibrated through Gabriel's body. Tears fell onto the pelts followed by mud. Together they
    pushed the pelts beneath the earth.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Dante lay at the base of a Weiden tree. The trilights emanated like a permanent but dying flame. Subtle yellows threaded at random through the long sinuous
    verdant branches of the Weiden and faded into an ever-darker green. The Weiden’s trunk was a black wick supporting the umbrella of green and yellow flame
    burning aside vibrant rivers edge. The flames consisted of the long ovular leaves of the Weiden that came to a triangular point opposite the stem, like
    arboreal feathers. All blurred from a distance into an impressionistic piece.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Schildkroete</em>—feeling the slight vibrations of movements on the bank—pushed its head through the surface and swam towards shore.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had never seen such an ugly creature before. A head of tight green skin breached the surface, with a toothless mouth, like a hairless old man,
    gummy and flaunting a sour complexion. The toothless gums moved with the intake of air, as the warted face obscured the bulging solid brown eyes that
    swiveled in all directions, yet seemed utterly ignorant of any light. Gabriel wondered if they were truly eyes or perhaps some other organ of sense that
    only this environment could influence evolution into selecting.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> crawled its massive carapace onto shore. Too eager, Gabriel clamored onto the <em>Schildkroete</em>,, but Gabriel immediately slipped tumbling off
    the side of the shell face first into the shallow muddy bank, as if even friction did not exist in the forest. Slime oozed out of the pores of the shell
    covering it an ungraspable slick film. Gabriel observed and strategized a new path of ascension. Again he slid off with the ease of seawater on an agile
    otters coat. He sat defeated and covered in mud next to the <em>weisswölfe</em> who had put only one paw onto the tortoise before giving up. Conquering this slick
    river glacier needed a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s mind enacted a web of problem solving algorithms until a singular moment of lucidity occurred from deep within his memory. As a small child,
    Gabriel spent many summer evenings catching the small pinguid tortoises in the creek behind his father’s house. Coffee grounds had been the remedy to
    secure the tortoises. They were sensitive to the diuretic effects of the coffee’s caffeine and dried to conserve water. Gabriel mined a few coffee beans
    from the darkened depths of his bag, but found only four that strayed from the long-depleted canister. He needed far more, so he stretched his hand
    containing the few beans out to the <em>weisswölfe</em>, beneath its long-distance tracker. A lifetime in constant darkness gave the <em>weisswölfe</em> an incredibly potent
    sense of smell, far greater than even the highly developed sense of smell of a sophisticated scent hound. A quick whiff and then the <em>weisswölfe</em> disappeared
    past the light and into the vacancy of the miles upon miles of forest.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Schildkroete</em> nudged Gabriel with his leather face, and opened and closed its mouth, a sign it was hungry. Gabriel gave him the few beans he had, but
    <em>Schildkroete</em> continued to nudge him. He showed empty hands and pockets but none of these efforts were any use to a creature driven by a simplistic nervous
    system, one that did not understand the world, and merely demanded without grasping the true consequences of those actions.
</p>
<p>
    Soon the <em>weisswölfe</em> returned with a collection of branches in his mouth and deposited them next to Gabriel as delicately as he would a live rabbit for
    young pups to practice catching.
</p>
<p>
    Handful after handful, he fed the demanding <em>Schildkroete</em>, whose shell dried enough to allow Gabriel to clamor up without soon sliding off into the mud.
    Dante had been pulled over to side of the <em>Schildkroete</em> by the <em>weisswölfe</em>, and Gabriel hoisted him up onto the wide peak of the dehydrated shell. The
    <em>weisswölfe</em> howled a farewell as Dante and Gabriel sank to the surface of the water.
</p>
<p>
    A v-shaped ripple spread out across the calm flowing river’s surface. The <em>Schildkroete</em> demonstrated its impressive hydrodynamics as it slit the water. The
    large cumbersome carapace lay just beneath the surface. Even without strong light Gabriel could recognize the sparkling fresh clarity of the river. The
    ripples shimmered a reflecting glow as he passed the light to and fro, and then disappeared meters below. Below lived the prey of <em>Schildkroete</em>: various
    nyctophiliac fish, eyeless out of necessity, yet highly sensitive, hence the <em>Schildkroete</em>’s impeccable skill in silent, quick swimming.
</p>
<p>
    As they reached the bank, the <em>Schildkroete</em> transitioned from a capable and swift machine into an obvious interloper, with effortful clawing and wiggling in
    a struggle to pull itself a couple meters out of the water.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel hopped off, and with a careful pull slid Dante down onto the overgrown bank of the river.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> watched Gabriel and seemed to be tracking Gabriel's hands. It traced a shape in the mud with its right fin.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel crept forward, his curiosity was greater than his awe of the rival intelligence, or was it skepticism, that the curiosity sought to support or
    refute? There was the shape of a fish.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel looked up from the intriguing art.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> motioned towards its back with its head.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s expression changed from a mix of confusion and awe to the sudden realization that the <em>Schildkroete</em> wanted payment for the journey: one fish.
</p>
<p>
    Or would the <em>Schildkroete</em> take any food?
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled a long link of smoked sausage from his bag and offered it with just a bit of hesitation.
</p>
<p>
    That hesitation was short lived as the <em>Schildkroete</em> snatched the sausage immediately out of his hand.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stretched his hand out and patted the <em>Schildkroete</em> gently on the head.
</p>
<p>
    “You have served us well today and deserve a respectable name. I will name you Reprobus,.”
</p>
<p>
    Satisfied, Reprobus struggled back into his element, submerged beneath the disturbed currents of the otherwise stoic river.
</p>
<p>
    Dante stirred.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel kneeled down and covered him with the blanket, “Rest, brother,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
    They camped that night on the opposite riverbank.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel awoke. Was it day or night? Did such differences matter in a land of expansive darkness? He looked immediately towards Dante, but Dante wasn’t
    there.
</p>
<p>
    . “Come join me, Gabriel, the water is revitalizing, ”Dante’s voice came from the direction of the river.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, you’re injured and should still be resting!”
</p>
<p>
    “The water heals, come experience it for yourself!”
</p>
<p>
    Dante swam up to the shore. Gabriel knelt down in front him and turned the light’s glow towards the river.
</p>
<p>
    As Gabriel knelt down to feel the water, to rub it between his fingers, and discern the restorative property, Dante grabbed his arm pulling him into the
    undulating darkness.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel, surprised, flailed his arms and tried to the fight the water off before his rational side took control and he eased seamlessly into a steady
    motion, treading water.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, we do not have time for these games! You need to heal, and heal quickly so we can be on the road, Who knows how much longer we have before we
    return and father is lying naked and destitute in a street gutter, or even worse, dead!”
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, you let too much worry in. Just a bit of fun. And I am already healed. The water is medicinal.”
</p>
<p>
    “Medicinal or psychoactive, as it feels like a sewer to me. I will pack our things and prepare some breakfast. Please hurry out of there. I would like to
    be out of this darkness soon.”
</p>
<p>
    The frigid water had only dulled Dante’s senses. His head still swelled from where the poachers had caught him with their club.
</p>
<p>
    Dante related his capture to Gabriel over a breakfast of coffee beans and berries, “I had been walking for quite some time completely acclimated to the
    dark, and subject to the bizarre surreal visions. I didn’t see a light or hear a sound. I think I remember hearing a snapped branch, but unsure. All I know
    is that I had been walking one moment and then the next moment I woke up with a messy grin reeking of death and alcohol in my face. My entire body ached
    and was covered in numerous scratches, like I had been dragged along the rugged forest floor.
</p>
<p>
    “Did the poachers ever mention why they grabbed you?”
</p>
<p>
    “I was in and out of consciousness throughout the trip to the river, but heard “ransom” and “rich boy” often. I suppose they thought my life may earn them
    a little coin otherwise they would have drown me or left me to die. How did you find me?”
</p>
<p>
    “Before I get into that, can you explain what happened at the tree, with father?”
</p>
<p>
    “I only reciprocated a fraction of the contempt I have experienced in my eternal 18 years under that despicable man. Do you think this painting will fetch
    enough for an apartment in the city and some nice furniture, maybe a brewer’s den even? “
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, how can you think of just money? He's your father.”
</p>
<p>
    “I didn’t choose him.”
</p>
<p>
    “But he loves you.”
</p>
<p>
    “As a loyal empiricist, I cannot support that claim.”
</p>
<p>
    “He fed, clothed and cared for you.”
</p>
<p>
    “In that case, Ms. Steinhurst is my father. He drank, squandered money on gifts for us as he squandered money on prostitutes. Now he sits in a tree, a new
    man. He's not new, he's insane, his mind is broken. Now, you can tell him anything you wish, but please leave me for this painting,.”
</p>
<p>
    “No I care and yet respect a man who gave me life, even if the life he gave me was dysfunctional; it was better that none at all.”
</p>
<p>
    “And you know this relative to what? Without ever living, life is inconsequent.”
</p>
<p>
    “Life is a beautiful experience even more so for its end. From death finds life its worth.”
</p>
<p>
    “Life is suffering, and one who begets more life, begets more suffering. Now, please leave me be.” Dante gets up from breakfast and wanders over to the
    river’s edge.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel follows him and grabs Dante’s shoulder, “Dante, plea-“
</p>
<p>
    Dante turns quickly, and slaps his arm away.
</p>
<p>
    “You were always the favorite the Gabriel. You were the lucky one, born first and not blamed for mother’s death!”
</p>
<p>
    “Where did this come from?”
</p>
<p>
    “Leave me alone, Gabriel. This is my journey!”
</p>
<p>
    Dante attempts to push Gabriel in the chest, but Gabriel grabs Dante’s arm, pulls it towards himself, then with his other arm and an open right palm
    strikes Dante in the chest knocking him to the ground. Gabriel kneels down pinning Dante to the ground.
</p>
<p>
    “We both know, Father is a miserable man, and I cannot change that but did just save you. I care about you. Show some respect. I will join you. And the
    painting will go back to father. Are you with me?”
</p>
<p>
    “YES! YES! Just get your hands off of me!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel released Dante, and they continued for the remainder of the journey in silence. Although faint, three days later a dim light loomed at the horizon,
    like a distant celestial body.

		<h2 id="bioofd"> 15. Biography of a Doppelgänger </h2>
			<div id="bioofd_content" style="display:none">
<p>
    A few days had passed without any visitors, other than those who brought me my dried fruit or water. I had been in the tree for two weeks now. My limbs
    began to feel stiff and my body rooted into the sleeping plot I had carved out. Movement became laborious.
</p>
<p>
    I hear a piercing whistle.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante?” I thought, “but so soon?”
</p>
<p>
    Indeed it was too soon. Instead it was Dr. Samekh strolling across the grounds to the tree, whistling that aggravating tone Dante had taught him.
</p>
<p>
    “Knock, Knock, wake up dear Sir!” Dr. Samekh unlike his typical mild self beat against the hollowed tree with his bare knuckles and worn brown boots.
</p>
<p>
    I shook my head to test reality. Perhaps it was Dante and my memories were mixing.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve been awake quite some time, please no more whistling. I thought Dante had returned to throttle a poor old man again.”
</p>
<p>
    “I have an important story to share today.”
</p>
<p>
    “So Mikhail has changed his tactics and is now paying you not to avoid me but dull me further into insanity?”
</p>
<p>
    “Mikhail has no influence over me. I had business to attend to, many clients to attend to. Life is known to trigger a wide range of mental affliction that
    only a skilled doctor can reconcile.”
</p>
<p>
    As he eased into his seat outside my tree, I saw through the wrecked porthole that he had not knocked on my tree with worn boots, but new boots, Mikhail’s
    boots. I knew them well, as they were all I could usually see during our many reluctant meetings held from my tree.
</p>
<p>
    “Often I wish I had the strength to be a hermit like you,” said Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “I am hardly a hermit, but would appreciate your help with changing that.”
</p>
<p>
    “I always encounter the most vacuous individuals. A young female acquaintance complimented me on my new boots this morning, but I did not thank her with
    reciprocation so she chastised me for my rudeness. I told her that her self-esteem should be built on firmer ground and not rely on an acquaintance’s
    flattery. She did not enjoy that one bit. That does make any sense to one who is self-aware of their irrationality. We educate our children on how to use
    the brain but not on how to maintain it, which is a gross oversight I believe. Anyway, what did you say? Oh, yes, the boots. They were a gift of Mikhail
    and remind me of the boots of my adoptive fathers when I was homeless boy.”
</p>
<p>
    “When were you homeless?”
</p>
<p>
    “Like I said, as a boy. I was orphaned at a young age and lived with my aunt and uncle. My uncle worked at a small bank in our Carpathian village that
    produced hard currency. Our village was small and too far from a city to have large sums of money reliably and safely transported. So my father ran a coin
    press. He melted the gold, copper, nickel, zinc, and silver sourced from local mines, poured it into the molds and then once cooled we would have new
    currency.
</p>
<p>
    Well being a precocious child, I quickly learned the importance of money and came to despise its control over everyone’s life. My uncle had labored so hard
    in my short 8-year life, all for money. He shed tears and hair, all for money. For that I hated money. Life is more than little gold pieces. I hated money
    so much I came to consider it evil, and sought to destroy it.
</p>
<p>
    Every 10 years my uncle had to collect all the currency in our small village, count it and compare it to his ledgers. In this way, missing or lost currency
    was replaced every 10 years. Around my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday the decennial coin replacement took place.
</p>
<p>
    My uncle stored the currency in a basement one could enter from steps behind a false wall in his study. I entered the basement one late night, and stole
    all the currency. I dragged it sack by sack to the yard. My village was very small so we had but a few bags. Once I had collected it all, I loaded it onto
    my small wagon, hitched my mule and made for the Lucithian Bridge—a massive, 1000-year old stone bridge that spanned a deep and treacherous ravine. There I
    tossed every last coin, every last source of evil in my microscopic world, into the rocky depths below. The coins flooded over the stones. Moonlight
    reflected upon thousands of shiny faces. After the coins, I tossed the dozens of molds, which cracked and splintered into pieces on the jagged rocks.
</p>
<p>
    The next day I confessed all I had done openly to my uncle. He smacked me, and spit at me, and disowned me as his son. I had ruined him! I thought he would
    be happy, free to spend some time with me. Money spoke that I day I still believe, not my uncle. I struggled to explain that I only wanted happiness.. But
    he wouldn’t listen. He only spit and shouted, like a cornered animal.
</p>
<p>
    The villagers wanted death, my head for the thousands of headed coins I’d destroyed, for had I not only destroyed the economy but I defaced the emperor,
    our lord on high. Some villagers attempted to hike down to the ravine and retrieve the coins, but all fell and joined their dear lifeless heads.
</p>
<p>
    My gracious aunt spared me death, in place of exile. I rode back with my uncle to the city for an emergency supply of currency and new molds. But did not
    take the return trip. He tossed me out onto the streets with only the clothes I had on and I never saw my family again. My aunt had slipped me some sweets
    I hid in my pockets.
</p>
<p>
    For the first few days I wandered the streets. The sweets my aunt gave me melted in my pocket. I moistened my finger with my lips, rubbed it along the
    inside the pocket and then stuck it into my mouth to taste something again. I ate apple rinds, bread crusts, the little bits of fat that cling stubbornly
    to the bone – anything everyone throws away. When that rubbish could not satiate a growing boys hunger, I stole from the market stands and from the pockets
    of strangers with my nimble small hands. My life had become that of an animal always trying to solve the mystery of its next meal.
</p>
<p>
    After a few days that passed as weeks, the chocolate melting sun subsided in favor of dense wet clouds weighed down by the millions of droplets
    constituting them. Clouds hovered dispensing their immense volume a drop at a time over the city, until they dissipated into a billowy grey storm on the
    horizon.
</p>
<p>
    I awoke to the sensation of cold heavy drops splattering across my face at midday. Sleeping during the night was too unsafe, and at night is when all the
    restaurants and shops tossed their unwanted spoils to the curb, to my plate. The rain began to pour.
</p>
<p>
    I rushed up out of my alley, down towards the main thoroughfare Reganplatz. I crossed through the others running from a fright of rain and associated
    discomfort of sopping clothes, and into a small clock shop.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey you there!” the old shopkeeper called out, “You’re the lad that was caught sleeping in front of me store. No boy sleeping on the streets can afford a
    clock. Now go away, I don’t want any trouble. “
</p>
<p>
    I went back out into the now torrential rain.
</p>
<p>
    “The market was nearby and had awnings. I could dry off there.” I thought.
</p>
<p>
    I ran to the market, but immediately was chased off by another old but sprite Farmer McKenzie, to whom I owed at least three of my last meals.
</p>
<p>
    Afraid of catching a whiff of his cane with my skull, I sprinted down the thoroughfare and took a blind turn right down an alley, which turned right into
    another alley and then dead-ended at another perpendicular alley, at which I turned left, ran aside a narrow brick wall, then turned into a slight curve
    which dropped down under an old mill rising with a set of short steep steps into yet another concealed alleyway that split into three directions. I
    continued straight, turned left, right, and then left again. Finally I emerged from the labyrinth to a view of warmth and excitement. The train station.
    Only once had I been there on a family trip to visit a dying Uncle or was it a cousin? Anyway, I hurried into the shelter and solitude of a bustling train
    station, where everyone is too self-occupied to notice a small, hungry boy, utterly confused with the world.
</p>
<p>
    I sat on a bench in the lobby and caught my breath. Despite the excitement my brain was foggy, not all circuits were operational.
</p>
<p>
    “Would you like something to eat?” I heard this but did not process it because I did not attend to it. Sure it went into my ears and my brain interpreted
    the pattern of sounds as meaningful language, but I never assigned that sound of “you” to my conception of self. Not until I heard it again, and a little
    louder this time.
</p>
<p>
    “You look miserable in those wet clothes, can I get you some dry ones and a bite to eat?” asked a woman, I’d say middle-aged now, but at the time,
    “motherly” dressed for church and bending at the waist to meet my eyes.
</p>
<p>
    I didn’t say a word.
</p>
<p>
    She stepped closer and her calm demeanor masked assertions as requests. She told me she would take me and to follow her. She stood there with her
    white-gloved hand out. I hesitated until my stomach growled – a tumbling of air in the gut. A boy cannot grow on air, not like a tree can.
</p>
<p>
    My muddied hand ruined her pristine glove, but her reaction was flat. She fed me, clothed me, and passed the time of her layover with a human doll. She
    wished I could join her on the train, but she explained how her husband, the cynic, never wanted children. He expressed a desire to do his part in ending
    cumulative and convergent human encouragements of nature’s recovery of itself from humans.
</p>
<p>
    Tears welled in her eyes until she closed her lids and repressed the tears for what seemed a countless time. When her train boarded, she gave me a kiss on
    the cheek, shoved cash into my front pocket and fixed my collar,
</p>
<p>
    “Goodbye, sweet boy,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    She waved goodbye to me from the train, her gloves white again.
</p>
<p>
    Later that week another young couple with two children of their own woke me from my nap in the back corner of the lobby. They wanted to help me find my
    parents. I said I didn’t have any to find.
</p>
<p>
    The woman’s sweet words coaxed me from my nest of newspapers and forgotten clothes. Her husband bought me and the other children corn dogs and then ice
    cream. They asked me also to join them on their train.
</p>
<p>
    I ate my ice cream bites, not savory licks. I ravaged it as a beast that cares not for taste, only for the fulfillment of a meal. Their son was only a few
    licks into his cone. Finished with mine, I tried to scoop a bit off the side with my finger, but he caught me and bit down onto my finger, hard. I smacked
    him to let go as his mother turned around. She ripped me to the side by the collar, and I winced beneath a bombarding scolding.
</p>
<p>
    For months I lived usually a homeless wretch but occasionally a potential son. I ruined every chance I had in time due to an inherent distrust in anyone
    offering me love. After all my parents offered me love. True a couple families I did live with for quite awhile, but those were families of convenience.
    Tired of the streets, I’d rather accept some unsolicited love than fight another beast or bum for the scraps of travelers.”
</p>
<p>
    His story reached an abrupt end that preceded only a moment of precious silence.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh’s voice changed to a commanding and confident tone. Like a flip of a switch, all he had said was erased and a new subject discussed.
</p>
<p>
    “I have a business idea, and I think you’re the man to do it?”
</p>
<p>
    I peaked through my crack, and there speaking was only the fraud.
</p>
<p>
    He continued without hesitation, “So do you want to hear it? No you’ll want to hear it. I will open a clinic where dreams are interpreted.”
</p>
<p>
    “A true businessman never reveals his ideas too soon. I’m afraid you would make the worst entrepreneur. Now, please leave my friend here alone and stop
    imitating me,” said Mikhail as he approached me, my tree Mikhail had returned with an apology and rack of fresh bread.
</p>
<p>
    “I will have Sven repossess those boots this minute if you do not leave Dr. Samekh. Dr. Allemanne needs less, not more, insanity. Now, Dr. Allemanne I
    really meant you no stress earlier. I will leave you this fresh bread here, from Maurá a former protégé of Renomme, but only if you give me all the bread
    you have inside there in return.
</p>
<p>
    “I am no beggar, I choose this life, and this bread sustains me well. I will not waste it.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail tore off a piece from one of the loaves, “Here try this. If you do not take it, it will be wasted.”
</p>
<p>
    He shoved his bread-filled hand through the small opening in the tree. I hesitated then snatched it. I placed it into my mouth and chewed and tasted
    deliberately.. I had forgotten what I was missing. The flavor, the moisture, the texture, all in perfect balance.
</p>
<p>
    “Now will you take it or should I leave it to spoil in the coming rains here in the yard?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, no, no I will take it, please pass it in here.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail passed the bread through the mangled entrance, and then departed, not wanting to test his luck too far in winning anymore battles today. At last I found peace to transcribe my chaotic writings.
</p>

		<h2 id="anderseite"> 16. Anderseite </h2>
				<div id="anderseite_content" style="display:none">
<p>
    A dim anomaly manipulated the otherwise empty horizon and took the shape of a city. The dense canopy loosened into a shady overcast. Sun streamed through
    the narrow slits and for the first time in over a week, natural light fell upon the faces of Dante and Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    They had traveled for three days since crossing the river – their lights long dead. Their pupils, not shy of darkness, had dilated into large black disks
    floating on the milky blue of their eyes.
</p>
<p>
    The eidetic view of Anderseite fluttered Gabriel's heart. He had stepped into one of his father’s paintings. Vivid green trees, rich coffee colored soil
    and an intense blue sky framed a majestic city of wood and stone stretching out into the river, vast but purposeful, a liberal blend of urban and natural
    landscape. Above, in the sky, whirred elaborate flying machines, canvas draped bats and engorged blimps. Below at sea level, a second city appeared
    wavering at the surface of the clean reflective waters that surrounded the peninsula. Mountains loomed in an apt milieu. A painter need not embellish to
    depict such a masterpiece of landscape. Gabriel and Dante stared detached from time.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you see that movement ahead? I’m not sure if it’s a side effect of my eyes adjusting or something actually coming towards us.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel saw a vehicle approaching them, not a car or a bike, rather something so novel Gabriel could not even offer a comparable vehicle from which to
    branch his description. The noun vehicle can only contain the <em>beweger</em> in a highly creative mind.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, yes, I do see something.”
</p>
<p>
    “Shall we run? I cannot imagine anything from this forest being pleasant.”
</p>
<p>
    “To run will invite chase, and we have been on a days long hike. It’s a race we would surely lose. I say wait here, and be diplomatic.”
</p>
<p>
    The <em>beweger</em> was an electric vehicle operating on the principles of photosynthesis. In person one could see it took the form of a leaf, floating
    comfortably above ground with a narrow aerodynamic head, like the pointed end of a leaf, which widened into a thin body stretching back to where a stem
    would be, it had been functional in a <em>beweger</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A man, in his mid-20s exited and stretched his hand to Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “Welcome to Anderseite” said the guide.
</p>
<p>
    His English was perfect but the accent foreign. No one Gabriel or Dante had ever met or happened to pass along the cosmopolitan docks in Halvemaen had such
    a strange accent. Anderseite as known in Halvemaen, but Terenverde in Terenverdean, an antique dialect of Halvemaen like Quebecois to French It was the
    most deviant from their accent harboring the warmth of the Irish brogue with no attempt to constrain a passion for life. The guide’s skin was golden, but
    not bronzed, a supple buttermilk color neither taught nor flabby. It exuded health, wellness, and youth. His features were an amalgamation of man.. Such
    peculiarity was not apparent to him. His hair looked to be long victim to poor genetics, but actually was never there to begin with. He stood an athletic
    two meters tall in simple clothes exhibiting idiosyncrasies common in garments made by their owners.
</p>
<p>
    Dante withdrew. His body language screamed uncertainty and doubt. Unlike Gabriel he knew nothing of Anderseite. Only rumors ever surfaced, and the most
    popular one being that those who enter Anderseite never return, but they were still reigns on a limitless imagination. Gabriel immediately came to think he
    knew why no one ever returned. For by this misadventure they are glancing paradise. Was the forest a purgatory? A dark, spiritual holding place with some
    torment but not eternal? How has he died? Again reins on imaginations are important.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you want?” Dante questioned unsmiling.
</p>
<p>
    “My ID is D02041987. I am an Ambassador to Terenverde, better known to you as Anderseite.
</p>
<p>
    “Your ID? Do you not have a name?”
</p>
<p>
    “My ID conveys everything basic you need to know about me in the most concise form. The number indicates that I am a native, and not an immigrant. I was
    born in the generation D, starting from A, year two. I am from the fourth sector, am first born with nine siblings, and am in occupation eighty-seven,
    Ambassador.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel asked, “So, Terenverde, what is this place?”
</p>
<p>
    Its true name is one you cannot understand without a proper education in our ways, without at least understanding our values and heuristics. In time though
    you can come to learn these things.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, please, tell me, are you Dante and Gabriel Allemanne?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes-,” hesitation, unsure yet if he trusts this strange man and his drivable leaf, “that would be us.”
</p>
<p>
    “Good, good, we have expected you. Now please follow me. “
</p>
<p>
    The <em>beweger</em> floated delicately without disturbing the surrounding air. The movement was effortless and silent. There was no driver.
</p>
<p>
    The vehicle sensed trees, and there were yet many, many trees. The forest was thinner than the sense-sucking opacity of the inner-Pfyn forest, but still a
    forest, as one who sees <em>n</em> number of trees knows a forest from <em>n</em> number of trees as a grove. There is a difference but only the
    subconscious knows.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Beweger’s</em> artificial intelligence was superior to the evolutionary designed intelligence of most small mammals. Although it took the extent of
    time from life’s inception to humans, there was through humans a capability to create intelligence in an exponentially faster way, and one that was
    immortal, well, relative to the quickly depreciating flesh. Metal would in time too deteriorate, but that’s measured in lives of stars not in the lives of
    men.
</p>
<p>
    The gliding weightless feeling exacted novel physics onto the boys’ bodies. Dante vomited, hardly to ruin. D02041987 had expected it and was there with a
    bag before the first dry heave signaled the imminent.
</p>
<p>
    “This happens to all on their first ride in a Beweger. Do not worry, it doesn’t happen again.”
</p>
<p>
    The vehicle stopped at the most magnificent wooden structure. The smooth outer shell consisted of a series of connected planks. From afar the pattern is
    obvious. The building is a modeled after the shell of a Schildkroete.
</p>
<p>
    They entered the structure. Inside was clean, monochrome and austere.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you plan to leave?” asked their guide.
</p>
<p>
    “ We only need to retrieve our father’s painting and then will be going”
</p>
<p>
    “Ok you free to go then. Follow the stairs to a hotel. There will be a state tour tomorrow morning at the point of your waking. At that time you can again
    to decide to stay. Young men with your skills are valued here in Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    “Decide to stay? Why would we stay? We are only here for the painting then really must return to Halvemaen. We must not stay any longer than necessary. Our
    father is sick, and needs us to return immediately. “
</p>
<p>
    “You have not had the tour,” replied the guide.
</p>
<p>
    “No and I do not see us needing it, please do not expect us in the morning. Where’s the hotel?”
</p>
<p>
    “Up those stairs.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’ve been most kind, thank you, a little for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel attempted to slip a few geld into the guide’s hand, but he outright refused, with a tint of disbelief mixed with a healthy dose of embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry, Your coin is worthless here. Now, I bid you farewell ‘til awakening. “
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel awakes, not to the streaming sun or bustle of a city below. He awakes to a lack of oxygen. Atoms of 8 find no room in his lungs. His blood runs
    blue. The soft feather filled pillow has been so easily transformed into an instrument of murder. He chokes at nothing. He chokes at the depletion of
    oxygen. His brain writhes, firing in a disrupted set, sensing its own demise, searching its memory in a desperate attempt for solutions: life flashing
    before his eyes. Gabriel flails, the back of hand knocks an iron candleholder into the wall. His muscles cramp with a surplus of lactic acid. The oxygen
    needed to break it down lies on the other end of the pillow smothering him. With a frantic grasp, he grabs the candleholder, and violence begets bloody
    violence.
</p>
<p>
    A bloody mirror image slumps to the side and off the bed. Dante lies in his suit of skin and bones, yet alive, but looking so dead. How curious death is, a
    deamination of a temporal corpse, a ceasing of a mystery, a misunderstood end for an even more perplexing beginning.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel bandages his brother and drags him on top of the bed. He cleans the blood, and showers and then departed for the curator, not without first
    noticing Dante had left while he bathed.
</p>
<p>
    The curator would be considered a busy man, if efficiency was not revolutionary in Terenverde. For the entire city was a work of art, and Kunst was its
    curator. As an architect of Terenverde he retained his given name for all new his purpose and history. In Terenverde all talents were equally revered and
    encouraged for there was a collective compulsive will towards equality and perfection in everything.
</p>
<p>
    Kunst welcomed Gabriel. “Here have this cup of coffee. The smoothest cup you’ll ever taste, untainted by the faintest trace of impurity. There is no
    pollution here, no waste at all. You’ll discover that during your tour. Now, what can I do for an outsider?
</p>
<p>
    “I am here to retrieve a very important painting that belonged to my father and am to believe you are the man who can tell me where the painting is
    located. The painting is Hieronymus Bosch's <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>.
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot say I know the work, but speak to Gamut at the customs center. He may know where it went to after my tax appraisal.”
</p>
<p>
    “And can I ask if you have seen anyone else who looks like me?”
</p>
<p>
    “Like an outsider?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, and well, someone who may be my twin?”
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm,” Kunst’s eyebrows raised in sudden surprise, “no I cannot say I have. Why do you ask?”
</p>
<p>
    “If you do, please misinform him.”
</p>
<p>
    “I have to say I reserve the right to inform and misinform as any willful human does.”
</p>
<p>
    “Please trust me, it is for your safety. If you must know, my brother, my twin is after the same painting but for reasons governed by greed in which
    violence is quicker than tact. “
</p>
<p>
    “Greed? We learn all the common words of Halvemaen but sometimes they escape me. Is that a lust for possessions, for material wealth?”
</p>
<p>
    “Correct, Greed is a catalyst for the ugliest of evil and you will witness that by my brother, do not be an accomplice to his inhumanity.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ok, I have only a fairytales conception of violence, but will trust you on this else risk victim of my own naivety. My bet is in your favor.”
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you and I will be seeing you again.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel exited the curator’s office. A crowd marched in front of him, each one only following the one in front. He tried to slide through the strong
    current of tourists pulled ahead by those in front of themselves, but as he neared an end, an officer, whose tone and demeanor offered no room for argument
    instructed Gabriel to follow the crowd. Gabriel would be going on a tour after all.
</p>
<p>
    “This is not a commune, or a socialist state,” reassured the tour guide, “this is a society structured very similar to yours, however, everything is done
    according to the best possible way. Here logic and pragmatism not money govern.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel followed the tour group down a residential street with outdoor cafes, beer gardens, and trees. Gabriel had never seen such a city before. The
    street appeared to breathe, live and grow, albeit slow as a plant does.
</p>
<p>
    “In Utopias passed, there was no private property rather communism, no locks on doors, no privacy, all streets were the same length, houses the same size,
    each with just two doors. Clothes were like the grey skin of elephants, identical and only practical. A lack of any aspect of diversity resulted in a
    defectively dull and thoroughly boring existence. Terenverde is not a utopia. We have wealth gaps and unofficial classes. We operate on capitalistic
    principles and value individual achievement, but we are in constant state of change as our central computer, Fyodor, tries best to meet the needs of every
    citizen according to their ability, skills and desires. Our society is not influenced by the happenstance of birth, for all receive the same education
    and similar opportunities. They are thoroughly assessed and advised in all potential life paths that will contribute to the highest level of efficiency for
    the country. Religions are tolerated, though exhibited only by recent outsiders. We see value in a pious abstaining of meat or alcohol but don’t find these
    to be virtuous persons.”
</p>
<p>
    “Does anyone even work here?” barked an older gentleman.
</p>
<p>
    “As you noticed, all meaningless tasks are automated. Our citizens focus all their energy and work as wanted in expanding human knowledge. Many work in
    positions still too difficult to synthesize with a computer: Artists, Writers, Computer Scientists, and other creative professionals have proved
    irreplaceable so far. We are improving our capabilities everyday and expect mechanized creativity to be soon reached. This is not to sublimate natural
    human creativity, merely to augment it. Our end goal is a society of leisure governed by machines. Each citizen is trained to monitor, fix, and improve
    these machines and will spend a minimal part of their waking life doing so.”
</p>
<p>
    “Why not have the machines fix themselves?” asked a young woman.
</p>
<p>
    “We will have a series of machine fixing machines, but still need that security of human intelligence to ensure our best interests are maintained. We do
    not believe consciousness will arise in the machines, but must take precautions as consciousness a phenomenon not yet understood.”
</p>
<p>
    “Despite the presumed perfection of your society, there must be criminals. Where are they?” Gabriel asked.
</p>
<p>
    “Criminals are rehabilitated. But we would rather have none there. Our incarceration rate is near zero. You must be an actual threat to the way of life
    each citizen has come to expect here at Terenverde. Our reverence for education and virtual lack of involuntary unemployment allows only the most motivated
    of miscreants to emerge. Citizens have no reason to commit crime. All are invested in the whole community and it’s scalable. There is no more homogeneity
    here than the entire nation. There is no reason other than absolute greed to prevent its adoption.”
</p>
<p>
    “Not all criminals can be rehabilitated, some must be bad apples, forever poisoning society, “ said Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “Very few are ever that extreme, but we do have a few that have proved resistant to any rehabilitation. Randayn is perhaps the most famous name you have
    heard”
</p>
<p>
    Murmurs and shaking heads among the tour group confirmed the notion.
</p>
<p>
    “In case you have not heard the story, I’ll relate a brief version. Randayn valued his needs above all others. He was the most striking case of selfishness
    rising from incompetence. Despite all the advances in education and social support Randayn became a lost cause. He ruined his land by often urinating all
    over this plants out of idleness or trampled the plants before they could grow. Others tried to help him, but he was verbally abusive towards them and
    unwilling to cooperate, a slave to his impulses. For leisure he would wander the river embankment murdering frogs or any other creature that crossed his
    path. He never socialized with others in Terenverde, and the few times he did, was so loud and obnoxious he found himself soon alone, abandoned. So poor,
    friendless, a victim of a cognitive system gone awry, he changed criminal. He started small stealing food and beer, but it escalated quickly and he
    captured children, whom he made work on his incurable land and serve him, all to avoid his only superiority: stronger violence than children. He valued his
    happiness above theirs and believed his to be a moral high ground. The act lasted only a few weeks. Soon the charade of selfishness ended when the children
    wise to his many naps, tied him up and escaped. Like all irreparable criminals, he lost his rights as a human, become property of the Terenverde, and was
    removed completely from society.
</p>
<p>
    “Where do he go? Where did the criminals go?” Gabriel questioned.
</p>
<p>
    “They are removed and that is the extent of information I can provide in maintenance of their and societies’ safety.”
</p>
<p>
    “Was he executed?” asked the older tourist.
</p>
<p>
    “No not at all. He was deemed unmodifiable and housed in the most humane way.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about the others, how are they rehabilitated?”
</p>
<p>
    “We have a different forward-thinking legal approach in Terenverde. Criminals are the product of their development and our society does everything to
    promote that development. Whereas your prisons serve as impoverished mental institutions, we are future-oriented, so punishments are allocated to prevent
    reoffending rather than as societal vengeance. Criminal sentences are assigned according to his or her degree of recidivism. We use predictive modeling and
    actuarial tables, which have proven far more reliable than the worse than random performance of supposed experts and familial relations that infest your
    courts.”
</p>
<p>
    “That seems just like an extension of current law, which differentiates crimes of passion from crimes of premeditation, with the assumption that crimes of
    passion are less likely to be repeated.”
</p>
<p>
    “Very true, our scientists Bartle and Zotak have simply taken the status quo a natural step further, as they have done in their treatment.”
</p>
<p>
    “Those are Halvemaen scientists.”
</p>
<p>
    “No longer. They have come here to dodge the risk of the mayor or some other dystopian elite from using it to erase memories of their crimes. You too can
    stay here if you like.”
</p>
<p>
    “And what is this science of modifiability?”
</p>
<p>
    “Memory alteration. Bartle and Zotak realized that we already use drugs to alter our memories. Humans use alcohol to repress memories, nostalgia and
    embellishment to improve memories. But these are dirty inconvenient and unreliable methods, so Bartle and Zotak used biology and the theory of memory
    reconsolidation to create a virus that is far more precise. Drug addicts forget they are addicted, and violent criminals and their victims are altered
    alike.”
</p>
<p>
    “Is memory erasure necessary for all criminals?”
</p>
<p>
    “Memory erasure is the extreme. Our ethics compel us to modify behavior as little as possible to realign it with the norms of society. An average patient
    with low probability of recidivism and high probability of modifiability will first undergo feedback training. They are forced to experience but control
    their impulses. Impulse control is the only barrier between them and us really, between us keeping two feet on a tall building and jumping off. As a
    product of the frontal lobe, which doesn’t develop fully until adulthood, it’s the difference between risk-keen teens and risk-averse adults. ”
</p>
<p>
    “What makes a criminal unmodifiable?”
</p>
<p>
    “For whatever reason whether it is psychosis, sociopathy, frontal maldevelopment, or other problems they do not respond to treatment. Usually, they exhibit
    a form of frontal lobe dementia, deterioration in the orbital cortex wherein impulse control emerges. Unable to regulate their impulses, we must remove
    them. There are only a few of these but it’s inevitable, as we do not believe in the myth of human equality. Genetics and personal history forge a very
    disparate array of brains, with far different capabilities representing all points beneath the curve.”
</p>
<p>
    “This has been recognized in our academic system, but our legal system in Halvemaen is wistful, limited to treating only the legally retarded and children
    according to mental capacity.”
</p>
<p>
    “The solution is expensive and like much of science opaque to intuition initially, but our policy of indexing neuroplasticity has been far more successful
    than a folkish following of the human-equality myth.”
</p>
<p>
    The façade of Terenverde was its greatest proponent. The city though made of dirt, wood, and stone contained not a scrap of litter. Vandals had left the
    glass and expanses of urban walls barren, but Gabriel could not grasp a near perfect society without social injustice. Is not meager wealth and sadness the
    fuel of a poet? He was born into considerable wealth and considered an important position to be in. Not because wealth meant importance. He believed he was
    one of the few responsible to maintain the injustice that drives civilization forward. He was to choose what art and science was to be supported, and
    believed, in his respectable and reasonable conservative way, that this was the only way truly innovative projects would succeed. His thoughts compelled
    another question, “Then this must surely be a boring failure of a place. How can art flourish without injustice? What drives a man to dedicate his life to
    a specialized science when he can instead spend it in leisure?”
</p>
<p>
    “Curiosity,” retorted the guide, “curiosity brought this society from brainwave to reality. A young man, who amidst the birth of the industrial revolution
    chose to think differently, conceived Terenverde. He was borne by a curiosity that made him wonder if polluting power plants and foraging violently for
    fossil fuels was truly progress. That curious man, Neudacht, engineered this entire society, which progressed seamlessly from agrarian to organic, avoiding
    the ugly industrial adolescence in between. There never was an age of industry, steam, rail, steel, electricity or oil, only the age of information.
    Neudacht brought the printing press to this oasis and through his methodical design avoided the wars of belief wrecking the world all around him. The
    highest technology has been engineered into the ecosystem, with solar energy providing one hundred percent of the power and recycling at near perfect
    efficiency. Design is natural and uses little resources, hence the motif of insects or bones that defines Terenverde’s style. Curiosity continues to
    motivate Neudacht’s predecessors. True, innovation may not occur at the rate of an industrialized society. We do not need it to. The engineering has been
    so meticulously woven into the nature that improvements occur naturally as needed and problems are eliminated naturally as needed.”
</p>
<p>
    “What is there to do then in one’s leisure if there is no one to entertain? And no problems to solve?” asked Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “We are not a closed society and do enjoy the few imports of entertainment from Halvemaen that we receive. Much of our time is spent in the company of each
    other. We cook long, slow, filling meals, sleep often, go for long aimless walks, and almost everyone is involved in a culture or other social club. At a
    club you can practice and share your favorite form of leisure with others. For example, I am in a oratory and foreign languages club, which assist me in
    improving my performance during these tours.”
</p>
<p>
    “You seem to also import trash. I saw heaps of it floating on barges during my ride down here,” said an older woman.
</p>
<p>
    “Terenverde in its constant ecological mission, imports garbage from surrounding communities using the generated heat to efficiently fuel furnaces and
    stoves alike.”
</p>
<p>
    “Halvemaen has much to give. Disposable is a descriptor as popular as organic,” replied the same woman.
</p>
<p>
    “So still following policies here long abandoned?” asked the guide
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel answered this time, “Unfortunately yes. Halvemaens are infected with an accepted cognitive dissonance. They bemoan low wages yet want everything
    cheap, which can only occur with low wages. Glorified mayhem of the holiday season is taught and reinforced as a constitutional right. Exploiting a deal or
    receiving something free is valued and praised in pious fashion. They blame the elite for greed, but pressure the companies the elite’s run for better and
    better deals and better return on their retirement investments. The savings is not coming from the elite; it’s from their wages. Retirement is just to fend
    off death in a terrestrial purgatory, propped up in front of a television by drugs that only delay the inevitable deleterious ailments. Yet I am complicit
    in this crime of the potential of the mind.”
</p>
<p>
    “Here in Terenverde, we know that public policies should be judged on utilitarian potential, on whether the policy widens inequality, provides less
    opportunity to the less fortunate, relinquishes economic security, undermines civil laws and government, ruins the environment, or detracts from public
    health. Due to this, and a predilection for education and brain importing, we avoid a society so frivolous and profligate in its consumption, fueled by a
    deluded idea of superiority. Rioting for goods is no more advanced than rioting for food. ”
</p>
<p>
    “In God We Trust, whom grants us yearly avarice incognito as heart-warming altruism.”
</p>
<p>
    “Bartle and Zotak proposed unobtrusive feedback training to treat the primitive impulses but were threatened with imprisonment. That was the catalyst that
    brought them here.” “
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel came now to understand his father’s position better. He was reactionary in his renouncement of this society and past restarting his life here, in
    this seeming perfect place. Perfect defined relative to human nature. Or he was maybe profoundly sick.
</p>
<p>
As the tour ended, he asked the tour guide one final question, “Where might one see a certain piece of art from my town called the    <em>Temptation of St. Anthony</em> by Hieronymus Bosch?”
</p>
<p>
    “What was that, a painting you are looking for?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes I am looking for a painting, called the <em>Temptation of St Anthony</em> by Hieronymus Bosch.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll need to see Gamut in customs. He’ll know. He operates our automated system Fyodor, which evaluates all material goods that enter Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    “So you have not seen it on any of tours?”
</p>
<p>
    “Please see Gamut. Now I must go, my three hours of work are done.”
</p>
<p>
    Gamut only worked one day a week. One day a week for 12 hours he would contribute his fair share to society. So only one day a week were any imports of
    cultural import considered. Since today happened to be a day Gamut did not work, Gabriel rented a room at the local Inn.
</p>
<p>
    A beautiful girl, near his age read an ancient book in the gardens. He approached her.
</p>
<p>
    “Can I ask what you are reading?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m writing,” replied the girl in a pleasant statement of fact.
</p>
<p>
    “What are you writing?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a treatise on love. I can read you a bit.”
</p>
<p>
    “I would like that.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel sat next to the young woman, beneath a dim glowing yellow light that gave the pages an amber hue. Her writing was beautiful; her hands delicate as
    she smoothly yet effortlessly traced her thoughts upon the paper. Her pale skin lay mostly hidden under a tightly worn earthen gown. She finished the last
    word and lifted the pen, then spoke.
</p>
    <br/>
	<br/>
<p>
    <em>“One true love is one of many loves.</em>
</p>    
<p>
    <em> For one with love can everywhere find love</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> which predisposes belief in good intentions</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> and a will towards positive notions</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>colors all in a glowing halo of</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        optimistic presumption and positive consideration.”
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “That is all I have for now.”
</p>
<p>
    “Beautiful. Do you have any other writing that is complete?” said Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “I do, but have class very soon. Would you like to join me and see a Terenverde school?”
</p>
<p>
    “How did you know I am a foreigner?”
</p>
<p>
    “Simple. You look like one. Now I do not know much about Halvemaen, but from what I have heard, your schools resemble prisons.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am homeschooled by our maid and nanny, Ms. Steinhurst, and would love to see the school. But first, we haven’t met. I am Gabriel Allemanne, and you
    are?”
</p>
<p>
    “Alessandria”
</p>
<p>
    The first course Gabriel observed was a chemistry or a physics, or maybe even a biology course. The lesson was a project to use a concoction of chemicals
    that heightened the efficiency of the steam engine and could be recycled to feed and water a collection of plants. A problem that still needed a solution
    in Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    The next courses were in financial literacy, sex education, software engineering and writing to persuade organizations to donate money for the students’
    final special project. A special project was the pinnacle of education in Terenverde and produced the majority of innovations. The students could not fund
    the experiments themselves though. They had to compete for the grants of organizations. The best writing and ideas won the most grant money.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had only intended to stay for a course or two, and meet up with Alessandria later, but had become to fascinated in the education system of
    Terenverde. Back home Ms. Steinhurst followed the curriculum of local schools, which required a tireless slogging through mundane history, memorizing
    formulas and answering questions to impractical problems.
</p>
<p>
    The last course of the day was a blend of history, political science and economics. The topic was the upcoming election in Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    “Can someone tell me what day voting will be next month?” asked the teacher.
</p>
<p>
    “Saturday” rippled in earnest pleasantry throughout the classroom.
</p>
<p>
    “True or false. I can vote but you cannot.”
</p>
<p>
    A student on the right answers, “Presuming you passed the political literacy test you can vote as can anyone who has passed the test.”
</p>
<p>
    “I can?”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you MUST vote,” replied the student “compulsory voting protects a functioning democracy,” he said as if a string had been pulled on his back.
</p>
<p>
    “Young man, which party do you follow in Halvemaen?” the teacher looked at Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “I am not old enough to vote sir, but father has favored the conservatives,” answered Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “The conservatives are one of only two essential parties in Halvemaen, and together they dominate the political landscape, choking outsiders like weeds,”
    lectured the teacher.
</p>
<p>
    “What parties do you have here?” Gabriel asked.
</p>
<p>
    “We have many parties, but only the parties care for the parties. We prefer to offer our citizens a variety of governing philosophies, understanding that
    only two is far from sufficient. Some parties have made attempts to combine to lessen competition and move towards the ineffective two-party system, but
    the TEC (Terenverde Elections Commission) prevents maneuvers that betray the intent of the political system.”
</p>
<p>
    Class came to an end.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Thank you for your invitation Alessandria. I hope I can one day return to this wonderful city. Do you know how to get to the importer?
</p>
<p>
    “Yes my father works there.”
</p>
<p>
    “Your father is Gamut?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, he’s the only importer here. A computer runs everything. He maintains the computer. What does your father do?”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s surprising you ask that question. I thought Terenverde was beyond defining ones identity always with work.” said Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “We are, but are taught on how to converse with societies not as advanced as ours in order to promote humility and prevent arrogance.”
</p>
<p>
    “I see, my father was a psychologist at the university and amateur philosopher, now he’s ill in a tree. It’s a tragic story, but I really am anxious to get
    the import center, so cannot discuss it at the moment. I need information on a painting there that will help my father. Do you mind showing me the way?”
</p>
<p>
    “Sure, its on my way to the wine cellar, In Vino Veritas, where I plan to meet up with some friends from class. You can meet me there after your visit, if
    you like. My father will be headed there.”
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate the offer, and perhaps if I find what I am looking for, I will join you.”
</p>
<p>
    “And how will this painting you are looking for cure your father?”
</p>
<p>
    “Its not a story I have time for, but can promise you I will tell it once this adventure I am on ends.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t make promises you cannot keep.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I only promise that I will do all I can to return and finish the story. Might even have a happy ending.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel approached the import center, an automated covered bridge over the Stillfluss. Imports float down the river, the machines pluck them, inventory
    them, and then queue them for human processing, if needed. Despite engineering feats centuries ahead of Halvemaen, they did not allow the sentient machines
    to fully govern imports wary of mafias, cartels or other criminal activity common among a lower intelligence. The central computer, Fyodor, manages all
    imports but Gamut monitored its every move.
</p>
<p>
    Fyodor regulates all life in Terenverde using the intelligent predictive modeling of its algorithms to decide a citizen’s occupation or in governing
    financial markets, or guiding all the true automobiles, the <em>beweger</em>, in Terenverde. Fyodor is even the sole recommender of legislation, which is
    then approved or vetoed by a compulsory vote of all citizens of Terenverde. All is controlled by Fyodor except that which usurps freewill beyond the
    convenience of its automation.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel enters the center. Peace-bots, an automated security force surrounds him. He is arrested and placed into a cell that resembles a hotel room encased
    in a translucent plastic. A mouth-sized piece of he wall is perforated.
</p>
<p>
    A middle-aged man with a sandy skin tone of the poetess approaches. He is bald, tall, broad shouldered wearing a fitted black silk robe and black boots,
    the toe just visible beneath the robe. Gabriel is reminded of the rich coffee colored soil in the city. His eyes swirl an exotic teal. When he speaks, he
    is deliberate.
</p>
<p>
    “Gamut here, peacekeeper and customs. You ask too many questions. The people felt uncomfortable. We do not tolerate uncomfortable..”
</p>
<p>
    “I am only here for a painting, and is it not your people’s prerogative to question and pique curiosity?”
</p>
<p>
    “Rhetoric is ignored. Why do you come for this painting?”
</p>
<p>
    “It belongs to my father. He is sick and could not retrieve it himself.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re lying. My sensors have detected all the signs to 95% accuracy. Your father is sick with ergot poisoning, true, but he will soon be dead, he’s
    terminally ill.”
</p>
<p>
    “Terminally ill? No he’s only sick from that awful bread he insists on eating.”
</p>
<p>
    “Incorrect, sir. Your father has a tumor on his liver. He has perhaps only months to live. He also suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy exacerbated by the
    intake of ergot.”
</p>
<p>
    “How can you know that? You have never met him. I am his son, he would have told me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Our information networks are pervasive.”
</p>
<p>
    “Will I retrieve the painting before he dies?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, he will not die, but he will not live either”
</p>
<p>
    “What can that possibly mean?”
</p>
<p>
    “Our systems are very unsure.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about the 95% accuracy?”
</p>
<p>
    “We do not avow to be soothsayers, though we make attempts.”
</p>
<p>
    “I need to leave. I must find that painting and return to my father. Can I please leave?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes...the painting...it was stolen.”
</p>
<p>
    “Stolen? Here in paradise?”
</p>
<p>
    “No. Certain groups demonstrate their disapproval with our society with attempts to undermine it. Our society attracts many wealthy individuals who bring
    their art collections with them. The smugglers steal the art and then sell it to your world. At first they made attempts to resell the paintings to
    galleries and collectors, but confronted an insuperable challenge of proving legal title, one of the three important aspects of any art’s value; the others
    being authenticity and provenance.”
</p>
<p>
    “So,” he said with a sigh, “they would sell the lesser known thousand dollar works in the local weekend markets and to unquestioning collectors. But the
    bigger works, the million dollar and often priceless works, were useless to them, not even on the wall, as smugglers did not understand them. And there the
    works remained, until one collector, a named Nathaniel Tyffyn established the Tyffyn auction house, a black market of art we have long sought to end, yet
    have been met by corruption.”
</p>
<p>
    So there was imperfection in paradise
</p>
<p>
    “Where are these smugglers at?”
</p>
<p>
    At one time they populated the mountains across the sea, and terrorized the city until the peace bots evolved. We have not seen any since, but this
    painting you are after is there to a 98.9% accuracy rating. Beware that these smugglers are motivated by only base needs so demonstrate quite primitive
    behavior. Legally, we consider them only complex automata, or beast-machines, or poachers.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pondered. Hunting people. Evolving, living city. Rating accuracies. Neither dead nor alive. An AI superior to human intelligence. Beweger. There
    were so many threads to follow in what could be an extensive philosophical conversation on the merits of this paradise. His father dying alone. He felt
    rushed. The present pulsated rapidly into the future.
</p>
<p>
    “How can I reach the smugglers?”
</p>
<p>
    “Take a <em>schildkroete</em> from the port. We will escort you there, and you will need these.”
</p>
<p>
    Gamut placed a fistful of coffee beans into his hand.
</p>
<p>
    “We cannot offer you any protection in the mountains, and we do not have any weapons to lend you. We will return your pack to you.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will be more than capable of protecting myself.”
</p>
<p>
    “Even against your own blood?” questioned Gamut.</p>			</div>

<p>
    I had exchanged the bread in hopes that Mikhail would resolve me of his company for a few weeks. Instead he came more often—optimistic after slight
    progress. But I did not eat his bread. I did not eat any bread. My life had slowed to the speed of a heavy pendulum swinging against a perpetual headwind.
    I struggled to shift a few inches in the morning. I stroked the smooth fibrous interior of the tree, felt another life moving slower into the future. A
    tree breathed but not in large visible heaves, rather through a long steady unhurried and imperceptible process. A tree spent years stretching its arms
    into the pleasant warm sun. I too had decelerated and could begin to sense the life of the tree. In this transition of timeframes, the present, past and
    future coalesced.
</p>
<p>
    “Knock”
</p>
<p>
    Was that a knock from an hour ago? Or a minute? I perceived at that present second, but a second was no longer a second. It was a reference relative to a
    different state of time and place. I responded relative to my experience of time.
</p>
<p>
    “Phew so you are alive. I have been here throughout the week knocking to get your attention,” Mikhail replied.
</p>
<p>
    “I heard only one knock and have only lived a day since I last saw you,” I felt the present quicken.
</p>
<p>
    “It has been a week, Allemanne.”
</p>
<p>
    “For you,” the present slowed.
</p>
<p>
    “Sign there.” Mikhail slid a legal document through the mangled opening of my porthole into the tree.
</p>
<p>
    The present quickened. The up and down, back and forth. Perception struggled to retain regularity.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me, may I ask what I am signing?” I asked
</p>
<p>
    “I just explained it,” the moment of “just” lost in my unreliable tracking of time) “Our company owns a small grove of trees on the edge of the Pyfn
    forest. We are renting them to your followers. They are not as old or spacious as Yggdrasil, but your followers want to live in them regardless. To grant
    them stay in the trees, the church requires your authorization.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am not a prophet. I do not teach or speak, or keep any company without reluctance. I am here in peace in my tree. I wait for my sons, to have a life
    together, but no, I am here to eat my bread and live in repentance of an extravagant lifestyle. My sons are just worthless consumers like the rest of us
    animals!” The present lurched forwards and stretched thin.
</p>
<p>
    “Calm down, Allemanne. Your words are blending into a fevered mess.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who are these followers? The ones who built that statue?”
</p>
<p>
    “They have come and heard your teachings. Now they want to move into their own trees. The only other species are located in the grove east of the newspaper
    printers. So we are leasing them to your followers. They call you the Virtuous Man and praise you for your ability to resist the seductive impulses of
    instant gratification, to overcome your<em> innere schweinhund</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am only another swarming gnat in this branch of the animal kingdom.”
</p>
<p>
    “They are passionate, and prone to emotion, so moral and intellectual arguments have failed,” gave Mikhail in quick retort.
</p>
<p>
    “I have become then a figure of their religion now, optimized to exploit their emotional predilections. Morale and intellectual arguments cannot overcome
    such magnetic pull of passion.”
</p>
<p>
    “We mind as well capitalize on them. You can sign the contract here at the bottom.” Mikhail pushed the document through the Sven-made mangled opening.
</p>
<p>
    I uttered a vitriolic reply, “I have never taught or spoken to anyone. I am here to try to live in peace. Tell those sycophants that I will sooner see
    their trees—Flashes of pain erupt in the stagnant tips of my limbs. I pause and grit my teeth -cut dow- Ohhh! – n” the pain heightened, “than have them
    blaspheming my lifestyle with their misunderstanding of my present life.”
</p>
<p>
    I did not remember teaching or calling to followers. SME<sup>TM</sup> became a sovereign virus. That was not Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak’s intention. The
    doctors had discovered a way to discern neurons associated with specific memories and then through a biological coding system, alter them. The doctors
    infected a starter neuron with an altering virus. Memories were identified by reconsolidating them, and then targeted. Neurons harboring the mental
    construct of doctor fired and ignited infecting the connected set of neurons harboring cancer and so forth. Forever these neurons would always follow this
    pattern, always reserve this pattern of firing potential, though a retrieval of the pattern would obfuscate with age.
</p>
<p>
    This was alteration not apoptosis. To kill neurons would risk death. The virus only altered neurons in such a specific and precise manner that it could no
    longer play a part in expressing the memory, and did so by inhibiting proteins integral to the recreation of the memory. So the memory was not
    reconsolidated or recreated; it was not replayed. Replayability is a novice myth, an endearing metaphor. The hardware of the memory is not destroyed,
    rather the ability for that hardware to express a specific and unique series of instructions is destroyed. Memories are instructions that like the
    intricate folds in origami can never in their complexity be perfectly cloned. In truth, SME<sup>TM</sup> was similar to the way a computer’s storage drive
    erases a video file. Arbitrary 0’s and 1’s are written over the memory items. The material that stores the 0s and 1s is not destroyed, just altered into an
    unreadable nonsense.
</p>
<p>
    An issue, however, arose with the stop code that prevents the virus from altering neuronal connections associated with unconnected memories, memories that
    should be left intact. Through numerous tests and brain imaging—all a part of the proprietary technique—the doctors traced the pattern of the memory and
    programmed the alteration code to only iterate <em>n</em> times, where <em>n</em> was the number of neurons per memory. Ergotism changed that. The
    interactions of the poison with the central nervous system had sent the pattern of alterations off course. Proteins folded in unpredictable ways, and from
    the folds a malformation emerged. The alteration code became a rogue virus infecting both short and long term memory. One’s perception of time is wrapped
    up tightly with memory. Lose short-term memory and you lose your reference point unto which all is referent. But it was worse.
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Allemanne, did you not eat the bread I provided you? Please you really must live this grovel. You are not well and I worry. I had my doctor come down
    during one of your manic writing states. He diagnosed you with frontotemporal epilepsy. Your drastic change in personality in relocating to live in a tree
    like a ancient saint, hypereligiousity, in spreading the teachings of a false greater external presence voiced in your head, and the hypergraphia,
    obsessive writing, were all together indisputable signs.”
</p>
<p>
    In addition, an overstimulation to my temporal lobe had created mental faces with no physical basis.
</p>
<p>
    My head panned around the tree’s core. Cursive in a 1-point handwritten font lined in a swirling vortex from my height to the floor and over the floor.
    Writings that had overflown from paper. Writings I never remembered. Epilepsy. Ergot. Memory Eradication. My pitiful mind. Soon it would be the tree’s
    mind..
</p>
<p>
    “Sickness or not, we still need these papers signed and then you can rest.”
</p>
<p>
    “You worry that I may not sign these papers or change my will since my son’s are dead.”
</p>
<p>
    “Dead?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, its been decades since I seen them.”
</p>
<p>
    “They left only two weeks ago!”
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot recall much about that time.”
</p>
<p>
    “You had sent them on a senseless quest to return the missing painting.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail pulled the papers out from the tree.
</p>
<p>
    “I am going to inform the Abbot of your dangerous condition. Your time in this tree is done. I will not let you die in there.”
</p>
<p>
    “Could you bring me some mittens and socks too? I fear my feet and hands are so cold, I cannot feel them.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, yes, I can bring you some.” Mikhail’s voice creaked in despair and misfortune. His mentor was a beggar.
</p>
<p>
    I laid languid for hours (hours of an outsider as I no longer had an accurate perception of time). Only occasionally could I manage to eat or relieve
    myself. I did not remember moving, unsure if I had ever moved or only forgotten.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel clamored off the <em>schildkroete</em> and onto the beach at the foot of the lush forested mountains. There was a worn path clear of vegetation at a
    peculiar width of a man walking. He followed the path, the borders overflowing with vegetation well over his height and imagined himself as an explorer
    bravely slicing away the encroaching plants during his forging of a new route to an exotic location. He would plant the flag of his sponsoring country and
    make his name immortal. A vast metropolis, a school, a suburban street would all bear his generic name. Man granting man infamy in pathetic hopes of being
    granted their own.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel continued along the path until sunset. He had been provided some food and clean drinking water. He stopped for a break. He sipped the cleanest and
    freshest water his lips had tasted. The food from Terenverde was light in mass but filled him in only a few bites. He decided to camp for the night. A
    cave, his destination high up on the mountain, loomed at least a full days journey away. He had set out at midday so expected to reach the top by tomorrow,
    mid-day.
</p>
<p>
    The only technology known to belong to the smugglers other than instruments of murder was a massive telescope of unknown origin. The telescope sat at the
    top of the mountain and was a means of spying on the city for the smugglers. The telescope was Gabriel's first destination.
</p>
<p>
    No one in Terenverde believed the smugglers could have designed anything like it. Whenever a new citizen caught the glint of the sun in their eye
    reflecting off the telescope’s lens, an immediate explanation was given by the nearest Terenverdean, “That is the old smuggler’s telescope stolen off an
    ancient ship of a more purposed people that sailed the Ocean until it shipwrecked into the rocks on Terenverde of the mountain.” Or, “that telescope was
    stolen before the time of <em>peacebots</em> from an absentminded inventor at the edge of Terenverde.” Or, “that fell off a massive airship that was tossed
    in a storm.” Or even rumors spread that some smugglers had actually assimilated into society despite their primitive intelligence. This was the speculation
    of overly imaginative children.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel treaded with care, with an expectance of a sudden attack.
</p>
<p>
    There would be no sudden attack. Indirect forces of the town had exterminated the smugglers. The peace bots excluded them from their fulfilling their
    purpose and so nature, no longer in need of them, by design, caused horrific civil war. Caused is a strong term. One must eat. Without food, the brain
    retreats to instincts. The smugglers separated into familial tribes and factions, and were willed into murder. One arbitrary tribe connected by the fault
    of and simplistic connection of a perceived bloodline invaded an arbitrary geometric space of another tribe, which invited arbitrary violence. Tribes
    relied on arbitrary beliefs in arbitrary creations of stagnant fearful imaginations to prevent despair, which would surely arise if all this was all for
    nothing. A wrong arbitrary belief was death, for an affront on a belief is an affront of the person. Yet were these beliefs not meant to prevent death, to
    propagate eternal life? Were the beliefs only justifications for murder of nonconformists and genocide? The propensity for these beings to escalate so
    thoughtlessly to the extreme was considered a fault of pets in Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    The sun warmed a temperate temperature. The river’s long winding secret was no longer hidden in Gabriel’s higher perspective. He climbed up above
    Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    The telescope had detached from its sturdy home and become irreparable. The thick lens was cracked into a thousand random paths. Its enormous weight sunk
    it deep into the moist ground.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the telescope was a cave. This was not a smallish opening that may have served a small family, rather it was a grand opening fitting of a gateway to
    a new city. Gabriel sensed the painting was near.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stepped into the cave and fell. He tumbled through the air. One moment he was headfirst, another feet first, another headfirst, another feet first,
    another headfirst, another at an angle leading with his right shoulder. His back left shoulder collided into a protruding rock slab, which shattered his
    left humorous, tore the ligaments from their hold and rendered his arm useless.
</p>
<p>
    At that moment, the pain was there but his worries greater. He had slowed but-
</p>
<p>
    SPLASH!
</p>
<p>
    He lands in a shallow pool, struggles to swim with one arm while not moving the other too much. The pain breaches an imperceptible threshold as his brain
    floods itself with endorphins. He's numb, yet surprised and injured in a deep cavern in the hallowed hollows of the mountains.
</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Allemanne, wake up, please wake up!” Mikhail’s frantic voice urged me into present consciousness.
</p>
<p>
    I often slept. My limbs numbed. Everything slowed. The tick-tock phase of perception from fast to slow ended. My life held in abeyance.
</p>
<p>
    “Your followers have all been murdered!” shouted Mikhail.
</p>
<p>
    “I insist that I do not have any followers!” I shouted in return.
</p>
<p>
    “They have been murdered! Did you not hear me? The entire sect wiped out in bloodied fashion. The police believe it was an act of single man. You must
    leave the tree. The murderer may be coming here next. I insist you leave. I will pull you out myself!”
</p>
<p>
    “This is nonsense, Dr. Allemanne. I believed in our friendship, but what was you, is no longer you. I am not even sure why I stand here now and talk to a
    personality as aberrant from the man I knew as a stranger. But I am here with my last vestige of hope. Please leave the tree for your safety. Your boys
    will hopefully return soon and this disturbing episode will end.”
</p>
<p>
    “My limbs are too solid and weighted. I cannot lift them and have been unable to feel them for days. I have not moved from this position in, in a very long
    time. My perception is a deception but of late; all has felt only slow and never fast. Even in these slow times, then I say, it’s been a long time.”
</p>
<p>
    Angered at my yearlong replies, which to him comprised translucent rumbles behind silence, Mikhail rips off the last remnants of the door; he invaded the
    tree.
</p>
<p>
    The interior of the tree was empty. There was not food or clothing, just my tattered pants. I sat slouched against the side of the tree near the opening.
    My hands and feet had merged into the inner bark of the tree. Mikhail ran his hand along my arm and onto the tree. It was difficult to tell where my body
    ended and the tree began. My limbs had become limbs of the tree. My head sunk into the green flesh. Thin tentacles of bark wrapped around my head melting
    into the supple green wood of the tree. Beneath my body was an outline of young and vibrant green arboreal flesh, like that of a sapling or young tree. My
    bare torso was untouched, yet human, save for a single lime green tentacle entering my abdomen like an IV. The tree absorbed me in a deliberate and
    intentional process.
</p>
<p>
    All lose mass to trees. CO<sub>2</sub>’s mass departs from people and becomes tress. Trees are not clever conversions of dirt, but even more clever
    conversions of air. I had eliminated the intermediate steps and become the tree: my magnum opus!
</p>
<p>
    “I-I-cannot believe this. How is this possible? You are becoming the tree,” Mikhail exasperated.
</p>
<p>
    “And the tree, I. For one who has learned to listen to a tree, no longer desires to be a tree. Instead they desire to be nothing, as they were. That is
    home. That is happiness.” replied I many years later in deep and haunting reverberation through the village.
</p>
<p>
    A follower from a far land by the name of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500">Moksha</a> knelt at my tree and recited foreign words, here translated, “I respect you when you stand alone. You are
    like the forsaken. Not like hermits, who have stolen away out of weakness, instead you are like great solitary men such as Beethoven and Nietzsche. In your
    treetops rustle the world, your roots rest in infinity; alone you do not lose, but strive with all your life for one thing: to represent yourself through
    demonstration of principles and in building your own form.”

    Dante departed, knife in hand, through the natural foyer of the cave, and ventured deep into the section of the cave constructed by the smugglers. The
    smugglers had long been extinct, but Dante anticipated new inhabitants in the narrow pathways. He reused the lights from the poachers of the Pyfn forest.
    Light revealed a smooth tunnel in many shades of dusty brown, with a concave floor, worn in the middle by years of eroding footsteps. An occasional sign
    glazed in mud and cave dust allowed him to self-navigate the chaos of twists and turns. Scrapes in some instances were unavoidable. He did not think about
    his brother, only the painting.
</p>
<p>
    Since he disagreed with his brother’s belief, he deemed that a justification for homicide. The dialectic of belief or no belief is itself as simple-minded,
    when one is too ignorant to understand the essence of belief, which is wavering and fragile, subject to sudden upheaval and deletion, nothing as
    substantial as life. People too easily abstract enemy beliefs onto the faces of people and kill those faces as a means to killing those beliefs. Human life
    comes to mean less than orthodoxy.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel landed in a brilliant surprise before unsuspecting Dante. Gabriel clawed forward with the last of his energy onto shore and went still. Dante
    rushed<strong> </strong>over to Gabriel and rolled him onto his back. He noticed Gabriel’s arm hanging lifeless and crooked on his unconscious body.
</p>
<p>
    Samekh approached my tree. He digressed on his new state appointed position as a state psychologist, where he spent his days assessing psychopaths to
    ensure they were indeed psychopaths. He spent his weeks entangled in the personalities of the conscienceless, which was dangerous for a man whose persona
    was an ever-changing expression of those he came into contact with. With consistent interaction, he began to adopt the mannerisms, ways of speech, beliefs
    and values of his company. This is how he had survived as boy, but it had evolved into a dangerous and unpredictable lifestyle. For most of his younger
    years, he became silhouettes of clinical patients, of the mildly neurotic and troubled clients he spent his days with.
</p>
<p>
    “I drowned a cat yesterday, and did not feel anything. I never have killed a cat before but always thought I would feel bad. In fact I felt relieved. The
    cat had been crying all night, really ruined my sleep. So I went outside, grabbed it behind its neck and held it under the water. Horrible, right?
</p>
<p>
    The assimilation with the tree had stretched my voice to an imperceptible low frequency. The valleys and hills of the frequency were stretched into a map
    matching a lifetime in both drama and length. Decades may pass before the slow vibrations complete my reply. However, in my current omniscience, I can
    confirm the opprobrium of his actions.
</p>
<p>
    “I believe I know why I killed the cat, why I am I. I read a recent study about the ability of people to assume the values, beliefs and attitudes of
    fictional characters. They call it experience-taking. The experience-taker becomes a simulator of a subject’s thoughts, emotions, goals, behaviors and
    traits. Is that not what I have done my entire life? I have only ever taken, no merged others experiences, made them my own.
</p>
<p>
    I have forgotten my own self-identity. Everyday I awake unsure of who I am or who I will be. Others could not withstand my endless silence. The presumption
    of an eternal trait drove and induced the others to talk in an endless stream, which flowed full of deep secrets and desires that only encouraged a more
    fuller version of them to develop within me. The only constant is my pursuit of an understanding of the mind. Is that I? Could that be my true identity? I
    cannot be sure when I also awake to a drowned cat. Is my transcendence of the self-other border a vector to living an infinite variety of lives? Am I but
    an empty receptor as result of my reduced self-concept? Or is this realization proof against my fictional “I”? Yet again I cannot ascribe the death of a
    cat to any of my patients, only to this “I.” My life is a grand “experience-taken.” I am a thief of lives like those psychopaths I have come to become.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps these monsters and I reflect the truth of the world as one gone mad. I do have not any intuitions about my disposition tomorrow, but am equally
    unsure to aver it as pleasant or sour. I have no desire to kill cats or worse people. I have returned then here after quitting my position with the state
    and plan to search out those obscure, “good people,” those who appear selfless and kind, though not so naïve to accept the evil their minds have
    considered.
</p>
<p>
    When I see baby, I am disgusted. I know the evil and harm it will cause others. The despicable selfish methods it will employ to hurt others for its own
    gain. A baby is a reminder of how disfigured one becomes through life. It is a reminder of the illusion of individual persons. Now, is this my personality?
    Am I distinct in my self-knowledge of being an amalgamation of man? Is my true identity one that searches for and assumes personalities then sits beneath
    the surface until it’s had enough and searches again? I’m hesitant to say I am in a frenzied mental state for I believe I was born into one. All the lay
    people are but fragments of a single mind “humanity” that transcends space and time. They are stranded in this space and time, and I have the ability to
    supply a compendium of the race of man, each individual comprising a fragment of myself. I represent an unparalleled consciousness of the multiplicity of
    man. I am a tangible reflection of the true nature of man, a single substance of billions of fragments, and must ruin the belief of innate individuality.”
</p>
<p>
    His stream of moral consciousness spilled upon me. Dr. Samekh's mind had absorbed so many thoughts deliquesce was natural. Clarity disturbed the static of
    his pretension.
</p>
<p>
    “That is it! I must reveal my true interest in you. I have only come now to realize it. I must have your Bosch painting, <em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em>
    , for it portrays this idea of a single conscious in an accessible way. With that painting I could convince everyone of this truth. At last the solution to
    my existence is illuminated. Tell me at once where it is!” demanded Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “That painting was an unfortunate victim during my initial episode, and is destroyed, only ashes” I replied, but of course, was not heard. The subtle tones
    of my reply emanated over years.
</p>
<p>
    “Your sons must be retrieving the very same painting. I daresay I will murder them if I must, but that is a desire I struggle to repress. I must control
    this responsibility of mine to express humanity. I must find a way to view the entire stream instead of a single connected current of molecules within that
    stream. Otherwise I risk hypocrisy. I must find your sons. For only Bosch dared to paint man as he is on the inside, and only through that painting can I
    appeal to the masses. I will not leave immediately. First I must remedy myself of this murderous demeanor by imprisoning myself in the monastery. There I
    can let a more empathetic personality infect me. This atrocious mind of mine is tiring to withhold.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh hurried with purpose towards the monastery, away from me, away from the tree.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel struggled to encourage life. His breath was slow. His heart beat strong but overworked with the little oxygen. His right lung had collapsed. He
    needed to rest at least a week until his lung healed, if he could last a week. He escaped unconsciousness and saw a blurry dark figure that sharpened into
    a creeping shadow. Dante had finally returned to leave Gabriel again to death in exchange for riches. Dante approached Gabriel’s dismal body, just
    functional enough to maintain consciousness yet feigning unconsciousness.
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, Gabriel, brother, are you all right?” Dante questioned with muted concern.
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, I, I just, I am not sure why I reacted so violently. I let myself go. I allowed my rage to assume control and let the idea of being an angered,
    justifiably violent person control me. The exhilaration of the chemical impulses conquered my consciousness like a series of stiff drinks. I apologize and
    will do all I can to prevent such an emotional conquest.”
</p>
<p>
    “I, I forgive you Dante. I apologize for hitting you so hard with the candleholder,” said Gabriel as he struggled to exhaust air over his quivering vocal
    chords.
</p>
<p>
    Dante cared for Gabriel. He shared his food with Gabriel whom had lost his in the fall. After they ate all the food, Dante spent hours gathering the Snow
    Ball mushrooms that carpeted the walls and floors of the cave. Each morning, which had come to be defined as the time he awoke in the light-deprived
    conditions, he stroke a charcoal slash above Gabriel’s bed and went out gathering all day throughout the caves.
</p>
<p>
    The slashes numbered 8. Dante only had a week of rations, now depleted. They must survive on the snowcaps now. Dante left to gather them from the nearby
    corridors of the cave. Each day his search stretched deeper into the cave. The carpet of mushrooms diminished.
</p>
<p>
    “Drip”
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Foreign noises disturbed his morning walk. Dante’s heart fluttered as it accelerated. Fight or flight initialized.
</p>
<p>
    The air vibrated in sync with hundreds of flapping wings.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s breathing accelerated. He froze though hardly conscious that he had. His eyes fixated in direction of the noise, his body statuesque in demeanor
    not regal.
</p>
<p>
    Hundreds of wings became thousands of wings became millions of wings.
</p>
<p>
    Quick successive breaths.
</p>
<p>
    Eyes unblinking.
</p>
<p>
    Pupils engorged with all the light they could absorb.
</p>
<p>
    Faster heart.
</p>
<p>
    Faster breathing.
</p>
<p>
    His heart,—once the only rhythm in the deadened silence —became overwhelmed by the approaching storm of bats.
</p>
<p>
    “I am in a cave; it must be bats,” thought Dante.
</p>
<p>
    At crescendo the bats never arrived. The sound disappeared. The wings faint, then no more.
</p>
<p>
    Sensory deprivation near that of Flotador precipitated hallucinations. To survive, they had to move. Gabriel’s breathing improved. The 8 tally marks were
    not fruitless.
</p>
<p>
    “I feared you would never recover, and I would be forced to abandon you,” confessed Dante.
</p>
<p>
    “I owe you my life, brother”
</p>
<p>
    “You owe me nothing. I almost took it out of triviality.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s legs had already begun to wither as his efficient body cannibalized the muscle tissue to supplement the malnourished diet of weeks of feasting
    only on mushrooms. He rose onto his weak legs, steadied himself and ventured forth into the meandering tunnels of the cave.
</p>
<p>
    Further in, the cave provided still only mushrooms and even less light. The light from the opening was lost behind the sharp curves and valleys of their
    journey. Dante struggled with hallucinations he hid from Gabriel. He hallucinated food: spicy curries, roasted almonds, the succulent juicy bite of a
    handful of blueberries, a refreshing hoppy Trappist brew dancing its complex flavors across the tongue.
</p>
<p>
    The hallucinations coupled with depression and a distressing loss of hope left Dante often lethargic and reluctant to awake each day. Overwhelming thoughts
    of again facing a day and the endless trek unnerved him. The anxiety became greater than the worry of not finding food. He began to accept his fate.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel gathered the mushrooms on this, the 23rd tally mark. It was the first time. Dante insisted that Gabriel never do it, since he would not be able to
    recognize the Snow Balls from their less edible cousins, <em>Agaricus xanthoderma</em>. The two species had only subtle cosmetic differences so the easiest
    method of telling the two apart was to break the fruit body from the stem. The <em>Agaricus xanthoderma’s</em> stem would turn an immediate bright yellow
    that faded white into the end once holding the cap, while the Snow Balls would not. Without light Gabriel had to rely on the less precise method of smell.
    The <em>Agaricus xanthoderma</em> had a subjectively foul smell, not of licorice, but not of anything analogous. It simply smelled of “to be avoided. ”
</p>
<p>
    The <em>xanthoderma</em> were rare in the cave, which made the mushroom gathering easier, but encouraged less safe protocol in the comfort accompanying low
    probability of unwanted effects.
</p>
<p>
    Dante plodded through the tunnels as a starved mute. He never spoke and ate very little. Dante was on a course to starve, not survive. His share of the
    hunt, a few mushrooms mashed and mixed with salt scraped from the walls, lay in wait of rot before him, like his meals of the past 3 tally marks. If only a
    few particles from the abundance of light, could permeate the void they wandered.
</p>
<p>
    Dante felt warm sunlight wake him from a long night’s rest. He opened his eyes to nothing. He opened and closed them a few times to ensure he was opening
    them. But black. Again the hallucinations teased him.
</p>
<p>
    Dante stopped speaking as he developed Dysarthria, a motor control disorder caused by a lack of vitamin E. Difficult speech became incomprehensible slurred
    and spastic sounds that came out frustrated and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel was starved. He scraped Dante’s share of the salty mushroom mash into his bowl and finished it off. As Gabriel finished, Dante made an unexpected
    movement. His nose twitched like a rabbit near fear. He snatched his empty bowl from the ground, swiped his finger along the inside gathering a viscous
    mound of the mash on his finger, and held the noxious mixture to his nose. His face snapped backwards.
</p>
<p>
    The mushroom mash did not smell of anise. Gabriel had gathered the wrong ones. He lunged and knocked the empty bowl from Gabriel’s hands.
</p>
<p>
    “nin-nin-n-NO!” he screamed, “puOHsin. Wrrr-OngMucsh rum”
</p>
<p>
    The mushrooms grew thousands of tiny spikes that prodded and poked Gabriel’s intestines worse than a fastidious fruit-buyer. Gabriel lay curled up in a
    permanent hunch, since positioning himself any more or less forwards left him in even more agonizing pain. The mushrooms spikes seemed to only dig in
    deeper. Gabriel attempted to vomit the poison out, but only succeeded in dehydrating himself and turning his shirt into a putrid mess.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s in his acute disturbed state mumbled incoherently from visions.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel cycled through fits of cold and hot sweats, his body failing to maintain temperature as his worn immune system battled for his life in his gut.
</p>
<p>
    The brothers commiserated in the absolute dark of a foreign cave deep within the earth, without real food and far away from the comforts of home. Their
    suffering mirrored that of their ergotic father. Had there been fire, they would believe they had found hell, and their journey to here was a cruel
    purgatory.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The damp lightless grave unraveled into a string of vibrant green fields stretching to the foot of imperceptibly tall peaks. Dante and Gabriel sat high
    above on a steep cliff, a castle sat in the center of the valley, the eye of a funnel. Seven wooden gates adorned the castle. Seven opportunities to
    improve their present predicament. Though much had improved in the unraveling. Dante’s delirium dissipated; Gabriel grew gesund — ills elicited. They were
    perched in dreamful strength; two twins descending through an inferno.
</p>
<p>
    Dante took the first brave step with a rigor mortis grip on the tufts of grass above his end, he slid down the side of the cliff onto a narrow path, half a
    Dante’s food wide. He leaned forward, arms wide, pressed in desperate intent against the crumbling cliff. Gabriel joined him, arms splayed as well.
    Together they slid, one dangerous slide at a time.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s foot slipped as the path beneath his foot zeroed into a dust storm swirling meters below. They continued to slide with hesitant steps, never
    allowing the lead foot the full weight of the endeavor.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    They slid on through the crumbling path, each step a gamble, their odds ever lessening in their favor. One foot crumbled or another, but not yet both.
    However if both feet feel, one would catch the other in a moment of cliché suspense. A fall. A scream. Emptiness. A hand, another hand. Saved! The grip
    would loosen and dwindle with the importance of the character to the story. Or the grip would strengthen inhumanly, and a happy relief provided all.
    Neither Gabriel nor Dante slipped, they slid and sling along the declining and widening edge. The dull edge blunted into a Gabriel’s foot width.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    Sweat binded dust to skin, and flowed over the curves and features of their young faces, betraying eye sight for decreased body temperature. Flooded eyes
    coped as the hands clung yet to the eternal slide.
</p>
<p>
    Right foot press. No crumbles. Right hand reach, grab. Right foot slide. Rightfootpress left footslideandpress. Left hand balance. Together they slid.
</p>
<p>
    Their sliding journey ceased as the path widened enough for their shoulders to swivel perpendicular and carry the brothers along their descent into the storm.
    All the greens beneath the steep slope were lost in the pale browns of a sand and dust storm. Violent capricious winds carried particles into Dantes hair,
    Gabriels eyes, their entire bodys exfoliated by a brutal beating of sand. Erratic gusts often caught them unsuspecting.
</p>
<p>
    As Dante slide onto a wider path an aberrant wind threw him face first into the rough uneven dirt, tiny rocks scraped against his skin.
</p>
<p>
    They slid with the whim of the wind. Back and forth, tossed around as the apathetic wind does, as a wind disinterested in human stakes in the world. The wind
    pushed Gabriel into face-scathing falls, and Dante did little to prevent his own current of beatings. The push and pull of the wind ripped moisture from
    the once lively faces of the brothers and deposited a thorough mix of gritty sand and dust particles into every exposed crevice.
</p>
<p>
    The brothers descended into the valley, resisting the dust as Anthony resisted temptations. Their tumultuous journey only worsened. A violent storm erupted
    above their heads and unfurled an ocean of rain. The wind continued to blow sand and rain as they sunk ever further into a deep mass of liquescent earth. Beneath the earth swam a creature with the appearance of a <em>schwimmer</em> enlarged nine times. Unusually large worms, gluttons of the mud, feasted upon all that passed by their blind mouths.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel and Dante moved forwards with careful step as they felt the muscular python-like worms wrap their strong pliable bodies around and then through
    their entrenched legs. The vile smell choked out even the stalest air; a sulphoric haze hung above the surface, a by-product of the worm’s insatiable
    digestion. Worried they soon too would be transformed into naught but sulphoric haze, atoms forever reappropriated to the cosmos, Dante and Gabriel moved
    quickly over the dense dam of knotted tree roots and into a flat desolate post-apocalyptic land blighted with haunting pits spitting molten gold.</p>
<p>
    The dynamic land spun new surprises. Dante and Gabriel escaped the enveloping, choking stench of worm haven for a sweltering rapacious land now suddenly given way to sullen swamps that awaited their chance to usurp every atom of the brothers humanity.
    Within the swamps animals emerged in their abominations of infected imaginations. Beneath the foul water glanced the twins bodies, lifeless bodies devoid
    of oxygen thus life, clinging to the surface just within reach of all that they needed but never were able to reach, so close, but never so far away.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Bleiben sie noch zwischen die neun Zeilen.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The distance to their goal, the castle, disintegrated with a sudden descent into an even fouler miasma of fermented death. Fire rained down. Small
    explosive rocks drove Gabriel and Dante scrambling down a steep slide into an abyss of granular mud, heavily textured with the genesis of decay. Every step
    disturbed the solidification of the boy’s medium. Their legs pushed against a burgeoning resistance until the tired muscle fibers spasmsed in their own
    resistance. Exhaustion. Stress. A confluence of negative emotions and states weighed on them. Incinerated rocks still fell, but their steps could not. They
    were trapped in a kinetic hell. Dehydrated, malnourished, the brothers trudged in futile circles approaching death as they circled the finality of their narrow
    existence. Within the trap, they pondered the nihilistic truths of the contrived life burdened by their personal tragedy, a normality of humanity.
</p>
<p>
    The necessitous brothers collapsed onto the back of a beast, exhibiting a three-dimensional creature that only distinctive imaginations, your imagination,
    could concoct. Rescue though Gabriel. Rescue though Dante. The beast deposited them in a cavern of ice, without an end; an expanse of deepening ice, cold,
    dry, and unforgiving awaiting its latest permanent tenants.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel awoke from his straw bed. The room had a pile of straw, a short circular wall of blackened stones in the middle, and some pots in the corner. The
    walls were an organic natural material unfamiliar to Gabriel, perhaps peat. In the middle of the roof, was a small opening for smoke, and light.! No
    murmurs of a delirious Dante either, or feelings of spikes snagged in his intestines. No there was not pain, there was a light! Gabriel’s mind cycled
    through the possibilities attempting to make sense of the light. Had he at last met death after first traversing hell? Or was he trapped in a dream just
    beneath his miserable conscience? Did the cave collapse and by stroke of luck catch him in this air bubble? None were plausible, yet one unthought was the
    truth: rescue.
</p>
<p>
    The smugglers were not extinct, only on the brink.
</p>
<p>
    A smuggler by the name of Drummond Greaters entered Gabriel’s primitive hut.
</p>
<p>
    “I fear your life’s luck has been exhausted. 65 miles of tunnels beneath that mountain and all but 5 miles have been abandoned. Our security and only
    reason for survival has been the hiding of that single route from Telescope Point to here, Tyffn, the last remaining smuggler village. Yet in blind luck
    you wandered the correct path and our scouts found you just in time.”
</p>
<p>
    “How long have I been here?”
</p>
<p>
    “Years…”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel became disturbed in his surprise.
</p>
<p>
    “…months, days, hours, what does it matter when your fate is decided? If you must know, we brought you in four nights ago and this is all we found with
    you.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond handed over to Gabriel a tallied stick.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel disoriented from the new surroundings, and unusual answers from his new host, stared blankly at the stick trying desperately to catch his mind up
    on the current circumstances. He had many questions, but first reached out to grab the stick. The stick had a series of notches on it, which numbered 42 in
    all. It was the number of days they had subsisted on little more than salty mushroom mash and water from the feeble stream.
</p>
<p>
    “Luck did not save us, the stream did. We followed its path that reassured us of life somewhere on the other end, as a stream must have a source we
    believed. Luck is too easy of an explanation, propagated by those too lazy or narrow-minded to find the correct answer.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond had long lost his penchant for argument. He believed life too difficult to spend it idle conversation that only stressed him further. So he
    shrugged.
</p>
<p>
    “Well then few of us smugglers are as intelligent or resilient as you. Many died wandering the tunnels. During the long sieges of my village near Telescope
    Point by Terenverde, we took the woman and children through the caves to here, Tyffn, just an outpost at the time. I was a solider, a rearguard who hung
    back two kilometers. I was ordered to not let anyone through my tunnel as long as I lived. After many days navigating the hundreds of miles through the
    cave without any food besides the mushrooms, the children would suffer. First, their speech slurred and they convulsed like drunks. Then the myopathy set
    in and they were too weak to go on their own. Their muscles were cramped, stiff, and completely dysfunctional. A series of rickshaws would make long,
    arduous trips carting the child casualties to Tyffn. Adults, especially women, were more resilient since they had more body fat capable of storing vitamin
    E. But we do not need to worry about sieges anymore, only a few hundred of us remain now. Many moved onto cities for less dangerous opportunities. The only
    ones left here are the old, like me, or those without any talents, perhaps too slow in the head to make a decent thief.”
</p>
<p>
    “The guide at Terenverde referred to you as “beast-machines” but you not beast or machine. You’re very much human.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is how they justify annihilating us.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel in a way felt sorry for these criminals, just trying like everyone else to make sense of life and find their own path of least resistance to death.
    After all, they could have left him to certain death in the cave.
</p>
<p>
    “But there is hope in a final desperate attempt. There is an auction today. We must finally sell our most-prized possession. The reputation of the Tyffn
    auction house is not what it used to be, but I sure saw some fancy coaches moving into town today.”
</p>
<p>
    “<em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>?” asked Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you know about that painting?” Drummond’s tone swayed serious.
</p>
<p>
    “I need it. It was stolen from my father and he’s holed up in a tree until I bring it back.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well I have never seen it, and do not want to discuss it further. Shall we visit your brother? He is well.”
</p>
<p>
    “You seem to know more than you let on. I need any information you can provide. I can pay a very large sum. My father abandoned his riches for an austere
    life in a tree, but left me a substantial sum. Name your price.”
</p>
<p>
    Drummond walked over to the flap of rough, brown cloth blocking the doorway. He peaked his head, his eyes darting about assessing the risk of his
    environment like an anxious mouse about to snatch some spare crumbs outside its hole. Satisfied, he sat down next to Gabriel, scribbled a number and then
    handed it to Gabriel. Gabriel took the piece of paper, nodded and then returned it.
</p>
<p>
    In a whisper that necessitated Gabriel to strain his hearing, Drummond spoke, “Today a coach will arrive and take my family away from here to a safe place,
    a place that I need not divulge for risk of safety. But it’s not a smugglers’ village or Terenverde. It’s a city, where we can start anew. Sure I may be
    middle-aged but I have some working years in me and want honest work now. This coach cost an exorbitant amount. I funded it by selling a piece of
    collateral, that painting. Smugglers had a substantial collection of art at one point meant as collateral. It was hidden and only certain smugglers new its
    location. That way we could prevent methods of mass eradication and have something to sell that was valuable enough to help us move and start again away
    from the prying eyes of Terenverde. Terenverde knew they could not kill all us without first discovering the paintings. Not even torture would work. We
    were bound by oath. A dealer has paid for the painting by the name of Gamut. He will arrive today and pick-up the painting in exchange for a coach ride
    outside of Tyffyn.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel knew there was something corrupt about Gamut. He had sent them to die in caves for a painting he had already bought.
</p>
<p>
    Drummond continued, “If anyone else finds out I have betrayed the smugglers they will kill me, but it is a risk I must take. I cannot allow my children to
    follow in my footsteps. They will not live criminals, societal cockroaches hunted and squashed without any thought other than that of disgust in the mess
    their death had made. The deal will happen during the auction. There are only a few hundred of us left and all will be there for the auction. The auction
    will also provide adequate disguise for the arrival of an extravagant coach. Many coaches are scheduled to arrive as the world’s most affluent art
    appreciators are expected for perhaps the last great auction by the once great Smugglers. I will meet Gamut behind the auction house at precisely noon to
    make the exchange.”
</p>
<p>
    “Where is the painting now?” Gabriel inquired.
</p>
<p>
    “I will not say, but I saw your knives and am sure someone of your talents can find a way of acquiring the painting, but not until I have made my deal. I
    may be old, but I was a solider and lived a life of constant prey. I can and will fight if I need to.”
</p>
<p>
    “No worries, I intend no violence. I am sure I can arrange a deal with Gamut. I know him well and though he directed us into near certain death, I do not
    believe in shedding any blood for money.
</p>
<p>
    Dante rested in a hut matching Gabriel’s in austerity. Most of the symptoms of his vitamin deficiency had been relieved. Two smuggler women entered the
    hut. The women’s smiling faces were dragged down by the years, and short white hair shimmered with experience. Both wore plain but clean dresses. They
    looked to be all the clothing the women owned.
</p>
<p>
    “How much do you think that painting will fetch us today? Dagamu says, ‘I think we’ll be able to retire to a small town near the water. Fish during the
    day; enjoy a glass a brandy at night. Finally have a moment to rest. Won’t that be great?”
</p>
<p>
    The woman rolled Dante this way and that way as they changed the sheets, wetted his forehead.
</p>
<p>
    “Eh, I’ve been at this too long, we both have, for such dreams. I never envisaged a Bosch in our possession.”
</p>
<p>
    The name “Bosch” pulled Dante into consciousness. It couldn’t be a coincidence he thought. This is the painting Gabriel and him were after. He looked for
    the source but saw only an empty room.
</p>
<p>
    A man entered. Dante recognized the eccentric dress immediately as that of Dr. Samekh. He approached Dante’s bed.
</p>
<p>
    The room morphed and was again inhabited, “Well, I say it will sell for 25 geld. What to do you guess?” said Dagamu.
</p>
<p>
    “I prefer to wait without expectation.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, Veretu, make a guess, it’s fun.”
</p>
<p>
    Veretu continued to work furtively ignoring Dagamu.
</p>
<p>
    “We can make it a bet. Both guess the price and then if I am right-”
</p>
<p>
    “I said I have no desire to guess. I’m more concerned with what were eating tonight.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh Veretu, have some fun-”
</p>
<p>
    Her voice trailed off like a faltering echo. The room was vacant. Dr. Samekh appeared above Dante. He smiled a callous smile, stared through his wide
    rimmed lilac rims nestled under his purple fedora, stretched his yellow tweed arms, and grasped Dante’s neck firmly between his white leather gloves. He
    choked Dante, with that fixed callous smile. A bright light encased the doctor in a mellow glow.
</p>
<p>
    Dante struggled.
</p>
<p>
    The gloves squeezed harder and cut off the air.
</p>
<p>
    The hands that once stroked a lover, passed money to the poor and pulled a fallen boy up, were now instruments of murder.
</p>
<p>
    Dante beat his arms against Dr. Samekh. He tried to scream, but there was no air to pass over his vocal cords. He tried to call to the women but not even a
    suffocated scream emerged. He was breathless. He knew a fight would only kill him faster, but he couldn’t resist. Once he had committed to fight, he would
    fight until the end. He squared up a punch that caught the doctor lightly on the chin. The doctor still smiled. He climbed onto Dante and placed his knees
    onto Dante’s arms.
</p>
<p>
    The weight was unbearable. Dante moved his arms with all his strength, but they only squirmed in place.
</p>
<p>
    The moment of struggle had become timeless. He didn’t know how long it had been. The light faded. Here it came.
</p>
<p>
    What had he ever done to the doctor? He always considered him deranged, but never violent. Did it matter now? The light around the doctor faded.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s brain became a high-voltage cacophony.
</p>
<p>
    Silence in inactivity.
</p>
<p>
    “Ughhckk-co- cough”
</p>
<p>
    The light flicked back on, no Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    The women rush to his side.
</p>
<p>
    “You all right? Need some water?”
</p>
<p>
    “I think it was just a bad dream, Veretu.”
</p>
<p>
    “Where’s the doctor?” Dante’s first words spurted out..
</p>
<p>
    “What’s wrong? We don’t have a doctor? Our Shaman was taken away in the last raid.”
</p>
<p>
    “No there was a doctor here, not a medical doctor but a psychologist, a mind doctor. He was strangling me. He had a yellow tweed coat on.”
</p>
<p>
    Dante read obvious confusion on the women’s faces.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh wore a grey burlap robe. Thick brown twine accented his waist and a hood draped heavily around his head. It was morning prayer, at 5:30AM just
    before sunrise. Out the window he saw the tree of Dr. Allemanne.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh had joined the monk’s to facilitate the adoption of their disposition, but one cannot try out being a monk, it is a lifelong decision. Hesitant
    about returning to the world imprinted with the minds of the many psychopaths he counseled, he saw no other choice but to imprison himself among the monks.
    Every morning, afternoon and night he prayed facing south watching over Dr. Allemanne, that sprawling hand of 100s of branches before the night sky.
</p>
<p>
    Dante recovered from his ephemeral visions of death and began to plan his escape. The smugglers as hospitable as they were, could no longer afford anyone
    trust. They took precaution in placing a guard outside Dante’s and Gabriel’s huts. Everything they needed was brought to them. Neither of them were allowed
    out.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel also planned escape. He dug through his things and found his knife. He needed a sharp blade to cut through the peat of the hut.
</p>
<p>
    The razor sharp blade slipped and nicked his finger. Blood flowed out a half-inch gash on his hand. He buried it in the thick sticky mud of the ground
    floor to stop the bleeding
</p>
<p>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s escape was quite easy but unsurprising considering his captors were themselves criminals. The smuggler society had once stretched through thousands
    of tunnels vibrant with the pace of a dangerous life, but now only a weak few survived the legacy. Many nostalgic, anticipated a quixotic return to the old
    days—the grand price of the painting their expected savior. However, not all were too foolish in their dedication to let an enticing offer pass them by.
    The guard, a father in his late 50’s, had seen the glory days of the smugglers but also many knives at his throat and buried in the backs of his friends.
    Like any noble parent, he wished the best for his offspring.
</p>
<p>
    Not all smugglers recognized Dante as the son of Dr. Allemanne. In his face though, the guard saw the face of Dr. Allemanne, who he knew as a wealthy man,
    a face that often appeared in tandem with the face of diplomats, politicians, CEOs — the important people that other dominant cultures followed. The story
    of Dr. Allemanne’s materialistic demise had not trickled through the tavern conversations that comprised the smugglers information network. The guard
    believed he could extort quite a sum from Dante in return for Dante’s escape. Since the smugglers had long been in decline, they had been living off what
    they could hunt or the little their slow wrinkled hands could steal. What kind of a sum should be demanded? The guard did not know.
</p>
<p>
    Dante handed him half of his father’s trust.
</p>
<p>
    Before his trip, he surprised Ms. Steinhurst disguised as a criminal and forced her to take out all of Dante’s trust. Believing a criminal had actually
    stolen the money, the bank’s insurance replaced it and Dante increased his fund by a fraudulent 50%.
</p>
<p>
    He lost that 50% to the guard. The guard provided directions to the forest and a map for his escape. He even gave Dante some of his clothes so he could
    blend in better. The guard would take the same trail. Even at the height of its decline, the smuggler’s code was still enforced with expected brutality. He
    could not be caught. The auction would soon begin.
</p>
<p>
    Dante ignored the guard’s recommendation. He wanted to find Gabriel, but feared he would be recognized under the scrutiny of a questionable request of
    release. Instead he made his way to the auction house. He had his full trust in coin to purchase the painting—the gateway to a pleasant second life with
    his father. The painting held so much hope in it for the smugglers, for the brothers, for the many wealthy citizens of the world now arriving at the most
    infamous auction house in the world.
</p>
<p>
    House Dekales in Tyffyn was world renown. If one wanted to find the most rare or exotic of goods, House Dekales is the only place to go. Sure one must
    ignore the illegal manner in which the goods found themselves at the House, but for those of the type that could afford to attend these auctions, pushing
    out such thoughts was a daily task.
</p>
<p>
    House Dekales was nicknamed the “House of Extortion” sounding at first listen to “House of Execution,” a planned misconstrual by the House’s adversaries.
    The smugglers stole a 17th c. Monet or roman statue and the only way to have it requited was to win it at an auction. Police could not be involved for it
    would break the unwritten code and surely disrupt the marvelous marketplace. The wealthy considered the occasional extortion then a mere fee for their
    entry to this elite and exclusive market.
</p>
<p>
    A cobbled road wound up the craggy knoll from which the cantilevered House Dekales perched. Road maintenance had been long disregarded, so dodging a piece
    of wall or withstanding a brutal pothole was expected. At the top of the hill, before the entrance of the House, parked the coaches of the wealthy. A vista
    emerged of the incredible density of the Pyfn forest, which disappeared into blackness before meeting the horizon.
</p>
<p>
    The House had been carved into the slouching mountainside, the entrance many stories below the peak of a bell tower. From the front, the House looked to be
    only a couple stories tall but in fact raised four times that. The smugglers did not build the house; it was an artifact of royal wealth millennia ago when
    man was audacious enough to spend a generation turning an inhospitable boulder into a magnificent home.
</p>
<p>
    The entryway was grand and retained its medieval technology. Two giant wooden doors splayed out in front of a half-oval doorway that could accommodate
    twenty men marching through side-by-side. Dangled just inside, above the entryway and lying in wait, was a barbed iron gate meant by design to keep
    undesirables out, but principally used by the smugglers to keep the desirables in, if anything suspicious occurred.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel dulled his knife with the constant push and pull through the peat walls of the hut. Now he looked for Gamut.
</p>
<p>
    Dante approached House Dekales,
</p>
<p>
    “The auction will be begin at. . .1 geld! Now do I have a bid of 1 geld?”
</p>
<p>
    The auction began with some cheaper items only meant to draw out the suspense. Everyone wanted the painting. No one wanted a decorative pot or drinking
    mug. Today, they had traveled the many miles and risked their dutiful upstanding lives for only the most prized item that would be the blather of their
    friends and covetous acquaintances, the painting <em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel reached the base of the hill holding up House Dekales. From this perspective, he saw how the road of disrepair curved around the hill and then
    split into many arterial roads that could take one to any of the seven seas in the world. Gabriel believed Gamut would hide his chariot somewhere along
    this road for an easy escape, likely behind the house where there wouldn’t be any traffic or eyes peering from above.
</p>
<p>
    Dante’s heart beat fast. He was sure he would be caught. There were too many of his father’s friends in the crowd. He pulled the hood tighter, but the heat
    of the congested room was unbearable. Sweat flowed steadily down the contours of his face. He wiped it again and again in rhythmic fashion.
</p>
<p>
    A vase sold for 10 geld. It was the second to last item.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel made his way along the road, and saw in front of him Gamut standing behind his chariot examining the painting with Drummond. Though difficult to
    see from his vantage point, Drummond appeared not as a man bartering freedom for his family but as a man grieving over their tragic fate. Gabriel crept
    closer, positioning himself behind some stray rocks behind the two men. His bright blue eyes against the pale glow of his skin caught Drummond’s eye.
    Drummond pretended to not notice him, but as he accepted the large pouch of coin, he gestured towards the front of the chariot. Gamut nodded and they
    walked towards the stallions with their backs to Gabriel. Gabriel’s chance had come. He could sneak into the back of the wagon.
</p>
<p>
    After much ceremonial pomp and circumstance, the painting was unveiled and bidding began at the unheard of 100-geld price. The first to bid was an exotic
    dilettante prince of some poor dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
    “101 Geld, “called out a middle-aged matron behind Dante.
</p>
<p>
    “105 Geld,” echoed in the corner.
</p>
<p>
    “110 Geld,” snapped at the previous bid’s heel.
</p>
<p>
    And so it began. The smugglers hope, Dante’s hope, the hope of rich and famous hung on this event.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel crept into the back of the chariot. He could hear Drummond outside telling an anecdote about a horse he had as a boy. As the conversation drew to a
    natural close, he rapped twice feigning a fidgety demeanor. A warning, Gabriel thought. Gabriel stowed himself behind some luggage. His finger throbbed in
    disproportional pain.
</p>
<p>
    “201 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “211 Geld, new bidder!”
</p>
<p>
    “250 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “300 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    “375 Geld”
</p>
<p>
    Dante held out.
</p>
<p>
    "A warning, 375 million," announced the auctioneer.
</p>
<p>
    The bidding was methodical among the anxious palpable crowd.
</p>
<p>
    Every new bid followed by collective exasperation.
</p>
<p>
    “300 Geld, 400, 425, 450, 475, 490, 525!” The impatience pushed the bidding up, faster.
</p>
<p>
    “550 Geld!”
</p>
<p>
    “600 Geld!”
</p>
<p>
    “650!”
</p>
<p>
    “750”
</p>
<p>
    In seconds, the cost doubled, then tripled, burgeoning to a bid of 1500 Geld.
</p>
<p>
    The bid surprised everyone, surprised Dante though it came from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
    “This is to be a record, my fare men and women. Fair warning, I am selling it this time. Going once, going twice,-”
</p>
<p>
    A commotion erupted at the back of the hall. An old smuggler with a torch barrelled through as fast as the crowd could part.
</p>
<p>
    “Its a fake. I’m sorry I sold the real one to a man from Anderseite. I’m a terrible traitor and come now to admit my grave mistake, please do, as you must.
    Oh, I am such a despicable traitor!” Drummond thrust himself forward, opened his grip and hurled the torch at the painting.
</p>
<p>
    Drummond was struck down with a successive shots from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
    Smugglers returned shots at his attacker, a distinguished man brandishing an antique pistol, far too slow to reload.
</p>
<p>
    All manner of defensive arms emerged as the scene collapsed into chaos of fleeing, death, blood, and visceral action.
</p>
<p>
    Dante abandoned the suffocating robe and ran around two men exchanging death by sword.
</p>
<p>
    A shot is fired in Dante’s path-
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had been on the road for two weeks stowed in the back the coach, and unable to carry out his plan of stealing the chariot. His hand throbbed
    beneath the makeshift wrapping on his hand. A disgusting odor and sign of blackened gangrene skin infested Gabriel’s nose. He gagged at the sight. His cut
    was infected. The gangrene ebbed down his arm, from the knick on his finger and invaded his blood. His body succumbed under the stress of a fever, weakened
    further by the weeks of a poor diet. Gabriel lay in a damp pool of sweat subject to an early death and evident of his existence borne into a trap.
    Alessandria wondered eternal.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh, now after his vows known as Brother Vehere, kneeled down for his evening prayer. Throughout the day, at each prayer he noticed a gathering in
    the yard below around Dr. Allemanne, the tree. The crowd grew with the forward arch of the sun and beyond the suns disappearance. Now the tree was alight
    in the gleam of a hundred angered torches.
</p>
<p>
    Rumors and gossip were sins, and conversation consisted rarely of anything but interpretations of the Bible, so all the news Dr. Allemanne heard came from
    what he overheard patrons discussing after the end of the service. That evening before his final prayer, he heard of a gathering at Yggdrasil by Peir and
    his followers.
</p>
<p>
    Gathered around the tree were insular minds of the average populace, contributing nothing to culture and on a pathway of returning to the earth having made
    no change upon the world. An intellectually inferior man of action, Peir Gerlofs led the group. Considering his obvious lack of appreciation for education,
    he strived to make cogent arguments about the path of society, but always equated this path with that which birthed a genocidal maniac and his both active
    and passive followers, all of whom were accessories to a murder of millions. Peir Gerlofs and his followers, like those of the manic, stared with the dead
    eyes of an instinctual animal, unable to actively process the true meaning of their actions.
</p>
<p>
    Peir Gerlofs had long preached claims of vivid images of death and suffering that came from the supposed black magic in the tree. Subsequently the media
    reprinted these images encouraging them to be repeated frequently in conversation, heightening the emotional arousal in the sensitive average; they became
    victims of their own subconscious acting irrationally and protective. Though the probability and likelihood of black magic very low, the ruminations of
    potential discomfort were too difficult to ignore, thus logic was ignored.
</p>
<p>
    Martina had founded this group but could not cure their emergent toxic ideology. They were a volatile mass driven by pluralistic ignorance, resistant to
    all argument and truthful revelation. Martina tried to point out the flaws of their reasoning, but was ostracized. No single member willing to admit that
    they do not believe what they believed all believed.
</p>
<p>
    Match strikes, torches thrown, and in seconds am I bleeding energy with the efficiency of a healthy flame. The bright orange and reds are reflected in the
    heavens.
</p>
<p>
    The timid crowd retreats surprised by the fierce wave of splendid energy warming their cold faces.
</p>
<p>
    Yggdrasil transforms into a beacon of light, radiating red-yellow into all corners of town.
</p>
<p>
    Red-yellows color the sky.
</p>
<p>
    Burnt wood fills chill air; smoke rises into the cosmos; cinders fall.
</p>
<p>
    Alessandria waits at In Vino Veritas for Gabriel, whom time will never bring.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh kneels, eyes-closed, with slow steady breaths at final prayer.
</p>
<p>
    The longest, thickest branch, Yggdrasil’s mast, swings disconnected from the trunk and obliterates the tower.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh and the church collapse onto Peir’s, onto his torched followers.
</p>
<p>
    An ethereal song fades in. The notes tell the tale of life. The music expresses joy itself, sadness itself, elation itself—emotions stripped from their
    contextual stories.
</p>
<p>
    “A sky deep azure, a navy of shifting waters mirror with iridescence like cascading ocean waves. So vast. A silhouette forever on the night sky, behold
    me!”
