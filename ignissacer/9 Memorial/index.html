    NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE!
</p>
<p>
    Had the filial foe returned?
</p>
<p>
    The unsolicited aural aggravation invaded my ecclesiastical writings. I snapped up out of my straw bed and yelled in drowned retort at the grinding and
    shearing of the controlled explosions of a gas chainsaw. I felt impulse to beat the walls of the tree but in a melodramatic surrender fell to the ground,
    fists open now on ears, and yelling.
</p>
<p>
    The outside industry subsided.
</p>
<p>
    I poked my head out the opening to see a statue mid-construction. The shape was familiar and at initial glance I could not place it. I could only feel an
    anxious urgency, a fluttering gut one experiences when the known is a blurred image on the horizon that all to slowly comes into focus. The shape was in
    fact me. Some men—well traveled in appearance— had carved my likeness into a nearby tree.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me,” I called out, “Why have you done this?”
</p>
<p>
    “It is a memorial to honor you, Sir, in honor of your donation.”
</p>
<p>
    “A Memorial? Ridiculous! The engorged meaning we endow death only perpetuates a natural fear. Doctors ignorantly prevent this passing that frees us of the
    irrational fear of death. They are too determined to defeat that which should never be defeated, that which defines our lives. Oh, how glorious it is to be
    unfettered by a need for food, for water, from the temptations of alcohol, boredom and phantom females of which I was plagued throughout my mortal years.
    To be free from an average of 70 years leaning as far away from the end of continuum as possible, from death. They try to reverse the clock but it cannot
    be done and should not be done. Welcome the picturesque end! I can see the picture painted in my visual cortex now transcribed into language all through
    the marvelous communication networks of the human brain, the highest art in existence and an art so often undervalued; the seamless automation of the
    computations murdered for trivial matters. A brain, now that would make a statue! Do you know about the clock?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes we know about clocks.”
</p>
<p>
    “No <em>the</em> clock, the one that controls our lives.”
</p>
<p>
    “An abstract clock?”
</p>
<p>
    “Let me explain. So there exists a clock, ticking away with supreme stealth. Each tick is a second of my life, as with any clock a tick is a measurement,
    by seconds, of life. This clock does not follow a circular logic nor will it ever repeat the process. The clock’s operation is of strict biology, not human
    designed but evolutionary/intelligently designed (you decide your creed); the last tick it makes will occur at the last tick my heart makes. The clock and
    my body live as one. It defies the pervasiveness of the doctors’ magnetic probes, as it is more hypothetical than physical. No doubt it is consistent only
    though as far as thoughts, and feelings are. They must be generated but the true physicality of them is more virtual, fleeting renderings of the
    brain—collective results of complex neural networks. The clock is a product of thought and so, this clock is that way a product of neurons, which in
    esoterica decide the breadth of life, the purpose of death, and in death release a symphony, an ode to oxygen entitled <em>Cerebral Hypoxia</em>. In death
    the blood pressure drops, oxygen becomes scarce, and neurons, unable to maintain normal and functioning electric potentials, all fire in a domino effect, a
    surge of high voltage. The conscious experience is out of body, white light, and a final magnificence in death. The magnificent white light, is the picture
    of death. So forget the end; better to celebrate the beginning with grandiosity rather than make permanent the death. Who needs another aggrandized
    businessmen sculpted and placed as a public bird’s perch or as a forced idol of an overall dull deed? The only memorial needed is one that conveys the awful truth: there never is and will be any <em>great</em> men”
</p>
<p>
    “You are no ordinary man and your deeds are of high interest. All know this and the future should as well. They should know the former coherent you, not
    this beggar you.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am not a charismatic authority who invites unquestioning flattery and praise. I was a drunk and horrible father most of my life. Does the halo blind
    that fact? Are not memorials for the dead?
</p>
<p>
    “Your story has already spread throughout Halvemaen and engendered a fervent following. We must honor you with an idol!
</p>
<p>
    “Those who follow my story will never reach it. Its naive to think emulation of the successful will produce success. I will not allow you to preempt my
    death for profit!”
</p>
<p>
    “Profit, no, but the new church will of course accept tithes. Followers need to demonstrate their commitment.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I hope you learn as I learned what the true cost of great wealth is, and how responsibility is never considered. Merely those who become rich, become
    rich, whether they are the most fit for the task or not. They do not understand fully the system that granted their wealth. They only know that they are
    entitled to acquire it far beyond any level sufficient although not necessary for happiness. That psychotic psychologist who spends too much time at my
    tree surveyed my happiness at the onset of my madness and will survey it soon again. There will not be a change for the worse, I can assure you. My basic
    needs are met.”
</p>
<p>
    One of the sculptors replied, “I was poor once. I had $5 and the clothes on my back. Then while walking through the streets destitute, hopeless and
    starving I saw a $1 bill rolling along the ground. I mustered enough energy to capture it and was $1 richer but $10 happier. I used that $1 to earn myself
    $10 at the casino and my hopelessness replaced with jovial optimism. So, why say money cannot buy happiness? I can point out any number of poor souls in a
    similar situation whose lived were enriched with some unsought wealth.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is the happiness of the first bite, of the first taste of forbidden lips—all fleeting and vaporous.”
</p>
<p>
    “At what point does happiness obtain permanence? That $10 got me a suit, which got me my first job.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then are you happy?”
</p>
<p>
    “I have no debts, some savings, and a simple home.”
</p>
<p>
    “But are you happy?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes-“
</p>
<p>
    “What makes you so sure? I can have that pestering psychologist give you a survey. If your means are so wily as these, then you must be motivated by money
    and thoughts of more of it, not less. One cannot be incentivized for this work without money—Move this memorial to the other side of the tree. I never want
    to see it. And any ceremony for it will be accompanied by my contempt. This is your one chance at life and you chose a path treaded into a valley.”
</p>
<p>
    I closed the porthole and felt trembling or so I thought. The trembles were at the edge of perceptibility. They came from inside the expansive Pyfn forest,
    where trees were born.</p>
