<p>
    Seconds or years could have passed beneath the opaque canopy. Precise measurements required a reference point that could not exist on the stimuli
    impoverished forest floor.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel hoped for a short trip to the river, and hoisted Dante onto his shoulders. The memory of the forest map he had studied in Halvemaen was lossy, the
    finer details disregarded in process of capturing the larger picture. He remembered the general relative size of the tree groves, rivers breadth and
    meandering trail from Halvemaen down into the ravine home of the Stillfluss, but the distances were details lost.
</p>
<p>
    Rustles alerted him. He froze, all his attention diverted to his ears and the narrow band of light that fell upon the void.
</p>
<p>
    To his right another rustle, he lashed his light at the sound. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Louder now, closer, another rustle in front of him. He twisted his neck swiftly towards the front. The light followed.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle left.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle right.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    He had light; this could not be nightmare. It must be an actual danger of the cloaked forest.
</p>
<p>
    Rustle right.
</p>
<p>
    Light.
</p>
<p>
    His throat fell into this stomach. Pupils dilated. Sweat pored out of his palms. Adrenalin spurted into his bloodstream. Sudden stress. Now is the time to
    fight, flight or freeze. He was frozen.
</p>
<p>
    Sweating.
</p>
<p>
    Heart racing
</p>
<p>
    Gulps.
</p>
<p>
    Then the <em>weisswölfe</em> barrels playfully into his chest.
</p>
<p>
    Euphoric relief as an intense stress response dissipated with as much conscious control as existed during it’s conjuring.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel laughed at the absurdity of the intense fear only moments ago. A soaking wet tongue rolled over Gabriel’s cheek. The sand paper texture playfully
    tantalized his facial nerves. He felt a mild itch of the knismesis tickling variety. Gabriel wrestled the <em>weisswölfe</em> off his chest, and gave him some
    reassuring rubs around the ears.
</p>
<p>
    Weighed down by the forlorn psychological burden of an ostensible perpetual trek, Gabriel struggles to raise Dante’s unconscious body onto his shoulders.
    With sweat and a single grand exertion he lifts Dante again on to his shoulder. Beneath his shoulders arose his shaky legs from the side of the muddy hill.
    The legs straightened then collapsed, Dante toppled over Gabriel's head onto the soft, moist ground, covered in leaves and botanical debris.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>weisswölfe</em> grasped Dante’s shirt and gave a communicative tug, then stared at Gabriel: an indication of the clever mind beneath the flesh-shredders,
    sensitive remote tracker and night vision of this biological killing machine—a look of intelligence beyond the reach of one’s immediate prejudices.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel laid Dante down and fastened a sled from the hemp mat and rope he had packed in Halvemaen. Gabriel tied one of end of the hemp mat to an improvised
    collar he had made for the <em>weisswölfe</em>. Together they pulled Dante into the void with a poacher’s light and the radiant eyes of the <em>weisswölfe</em> illuminating
    the path. Darkness drifted in and canceled the enlightened world black.
</p>
<p>
    With a careful smooth precision the wolf dragged Dante to the bottom of the hill but came to an abrupt stop.. In all directions, water moved in a slow
    southern silence. The weak lamp on his shoulder disappeared into the darkness before it reached the bank on the other side of the Stillfluss.
</p>
<p>
    Scattered across the surface of the water like stepping-stones, were rounded olive shells, the <em>Schildkroete</em>, or ferry tortoises, graced with a life in
    grateful impression. Once only hopeful imaginations of suspicious books, the fantasies of the Pyfn forest revealed to be true, and shaped the true meaning
    of wonder. Few humans dared enter here on foot, only a select few like Gabriel and the writers of books.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps this is where I belong, Gabriel thought. Not amidst artificial stone, steel and plastic, but within the confines of pure nature, like Thoreau and
    his pond, where no voice or hand can pollute, where one is not subject to the selfish decisions of those thousands who live around them in redundant
    revolting reflections of one another.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled the pelts off his back. He didn’t have a shovel, so he got down onto his knees and began digging with his hands, scattering the mud in a
    visceral search, as a desert man for water amidst intense drought. The <em>weisswölfe</em> joined him. The soft mud slid through Gabriel’s fingers as he formed a
    large hole. He hoped it was far enough from the bank to be protected from erosion. Together they made a large hole into which Gabriel placed the pelts of
    the poached <em>weisswölfe</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel leaned over the hole and whispered his condolences and vows of vengeance for such ugly and useless death. To take life for any reason other than to
    sustain life, Gabriel found despicable. The wolves were treated as objects on the path to mild wealth, their lives only worth as much as their pelts. Such
    tragedy.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>weisswölfe</em> howled a saddened shuttering tragic howl that vibrated through Gabriel's body. Tears fell onto the pelts followed by mud. Together they
    pushed the pelts beneath the earth.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Dante lay at the base of a Weiden tree. The trilights emanated like a permanent but dying flame. Subtle yellows threaded at random through the long sinuous
    verdant branches of the Weiden and faded into an ever-darker green. The Weiden’s trunk was a black wick supporting the umbrella of green and yellow flame
    burning aside vibrant rivers edge. The flames consisted of the long ovular leaves of the Weiden that came to a triangular point opposite the stem, like
    arboreal feathers. All blurred from a distance into an impressionistic piece.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Schildkroete</em>—feeling the slight vibrations of movements on the bank—pushed its head through the surface and swam towards shore.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had never seen such an ugly creature before. A head of tight green skin breached the surface, with a toothless mouth, like a hairless old man,
    gummy and flaunting a sour complexion. The toothless gums moved with the intake of air, as the warted face obscured the bulging solid brown eyes that
    swiveled in all directions, yet seemed utterly ignorant of any light. Gabriel wondered if they were truly eyes or perhaps some other organ of sense that
    only this environment could influence evolution into selecting.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> crawled its massive carapace onto shore. Too eager, Gabriel clamored onto the <em>Schildkroete</em>,, but Gabriel immediately slipped tumbling off
    the side of the shell face first into the shallow muddy bank, as if even friction did not exist in the forest. Slime oozed out of the pores of the shell
    covering it an ungraspable slick film. Gabriel observed and strategized a new path of ascension. Again he slid off with the ease of seawater on an agile
    otters coat. He sat defeated and covered in mud next to the <em>weisswölfe</em> who had put only one paw onto the tortoise before giving up. Conquering this slick
    river glacier needed a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s mind enacted a web of problem solving algorithms until a singular moment of lucidity occurred from deep within his memory. As a small child,
    Gabriel spent many summer evenings catching the small pinguid tortoises in the creek behind his father’s house. Coffee grounds had been the remedy to
    secure the tortoises. They were sensitive to the diuretic effects of the coffee’s caffeine and dried to conserve water. Gabriel mined a few coffee beans
    from the darkened depths of his bag, but found only four that strayed from the long-depleted canister. He needed far more, so he stretched his hand
    containing the few beans out to the <em>weisswölfe</em>, beneath its long-distance tracker. A lifetime in constant darkness gave the <em>weisswölfe</em> an incredibly potent
    sense of smell, far greater than even the highly developed sense of smell of a sophisticated scent hound. A quick whiff and then the <em>weisswölfe</em> disappeared
    past the light and into the vacancy of the miles upon miles of forest.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Schildkroete</em> nudged Gabriel with his leather face, and opened and closed its mouth, a sign it was hungry. Gabriel gave him the few beans he had, but
    <em>Schildkroete</em> continued to nudge him. He showed empty hands and pockets but none of these efforts were any use to a creature driven by a simplistic nervous
    system, one that did not understand the world, and merely demanded without grasping the true consequences of those actions.
</p>
<p>
    Soon the <em>weisswölfe</em> returned with a collection of branches in his mouth and deposited them next to Gabriel as delicately as he would a live rabbit for
    young pups to practice catching.
</p>
<p>
    Handful after handful, he fed the demanding <em>Schildkroete</em>, whose shell dried enough to allow Gabriel to clamor up without soon sliding off into the mud.
    Dante had been pulled over to side of the <em>Schildkroete</em> by the <em>weisswölfe</em>, and Gabriel hoisted him up onto the wide peak of the dehydrated shell. The
    <em>weisswölfe</em> howled a farewell as Dante and Gabriel sank to the surface of the water.
</p>
<p>
    A v-shaped ripple spread out across the calm flowing river’s surface. The <em>Schildkroete</em> demonstrated its impressive hydrodynamics as it slit the water. The
    large cumbersome carapace lay just beneath the surface. Even without strong light Gabriel could recognize the sparkling fresh clarity of the river. The
    ripples shimmered a reflecting glow as he passed the light to and fro, and then disappeared meters below. Below lived the prey of <em>Schildkroete</em>: various
    nyctophiliac fish, eyeless out of necessity, yet highly sensitive, hence the <em>Schildkroete</em>’s impeccable skill in silent, quick swimming.
</p>
<p>
    As they reached the bank, the <em>Schildkroete</em> transitioned from a capable and swift machine into an obvious interloper, with effortful clawing and wiggling in
    a struggle to pull itself a couple meters out of the water.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel hopped off, and with a careful pull slid Dante down onto the overgrown bank of the river.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> watched Gabriel and seemed to be tracking Gabriel's hands. It traced a shape in the mud with its right fin.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel crept forward, his curiosity was greater than his awe of the rival intelligence, or was it skepticism, that the curiosity sought to support or
    refute? There was the shape of a fish.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel looked up from the intriguing art.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Schildkroete</em> motioned towards its back with its head.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel’s expression changed from a mix of confusion and awe to the sudden realization that the <em>Schildkroete</em> wanted payment for the journey: one fish.
</p>
<p>
    Or would the <em>Schildkroete</em> take any food?
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pulled a long link of smoked sausage from his bag and offered it with just a bit of hesitation.
</p>
<p>
    That hesitation was short lived as the <em>Schildkroete</em> snatched the sausage immediately out of his hand.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel stretched his hand out and patted the <em>Schildkroete</em> gently on the head.
</p>
<p>
    “You have served us well today and deserve a respectable name. I will name you Reprobus,.”
</p>
<p>
    Satisfied, Reprobus struggled back into his element, submerged beneath the disturbed currents of the otherwise stoic river.
</p>
<p>
    Dante stirred.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel kneeled down and covered him with the blanket, “Rest, brother,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
    They camped that night on the opposite riverbank.
</p>

<p>
    Gabriel awoke. Was it day or night? Did such differences matter in a land of expansive darkness? He looked immediately towards Dante, but Dante wasn’t
    there.
</p>
<p>
    . “Come join me, Gabriel, the water is revitalizing, ”Dante’s voice came from the direction of the river.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, you’re injured and should still be resting!”
</p>
<p>
    “The water heals, come experience it for yourself!”
</p>
<p>
    Dante swam up to the shore. Gabriel knelt down in front him and turned the light’s glow towards the river.
</p>
<p>
    As Gabriel knelt down to feel the water, to rub it between his fingers, and discern the restorative property, Dante grabbed his arm pulling him into the
    undulating darkness.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel, surprised, flailed his arms and tried to the fight the water off before his rational side took control and he eased seamlessly into a steady
    motion, treading water.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, we do not have time for these games! You need to heal, and heal quickly so we can be on the road, Who knows how much longer we have before we
    return and father is lying naked and destitute in a street gutter, or even worse, dead!”
</p>
<p>
    “Gabriel, you let too much worry in. Just a bit of fun. And I am already healed. The water is medicinal.”
</p>
<p>
    “Medicinal or psychoactive, as it feels like a sewer to me. I will pack our things and prepare some breakfast. Please hurry out of there. I would like to
    be out of this darkness soon.”
</p>
<p>
    The frigid water had only dulled Dante’s senses. His head still swelled from where the poachers had caught him with their club.
</p>
<p>
    Dante related his capture to Gabriel over a breakfast of coffee beans and berries, “I had been walking for quite some time completely acclimated to the
    dark, and subject to the bizarre surreal visions. I didn’t see a light or hear a sound. I think I remember hearing a snapped branch, but unsure. All I know
    is that I had been walking one moment and then the next moment I woke up with a messy grin reeking of death and alcohol in my face. My entire body ached
    and was covered in numerous scratches, like I had been dragged along the rugged forest floor.
</p>
<p>
    “Did the poachers ever mention why they grabbed you?”
</p>
<p>
    “I was in and out of consciousness throughout the trip to the river, but heard “ransom” and “rich boy” often. I suppose they thought my life may earn them
    a little coin otherwise they would have drown me or left me to die. How did you find me?”
</p>
<p>
    “Before I get into that, can you explain what happened at the tree, with father?”
</p>
<p>
    “I only reciprocated a fraction of the contempt I have experienced in my eternal 18 years under that despicable man. Do you think this painting will fetch
    enough for an apartment in the city and some nice furniture, maybe a brewer’s den even? “
</p>
<p>
    “Dante, how can you think of just money? He's your father.”
</p>
<p>
    “I didn’t choose him.”
</p>
<p>
    “But he loves you.”
</p>
<p>
    “As a loyal empiricist, I cannot support that claim.”
</p>
<p>
    “He fed, clothed and cared for you.”
</p>
<p>
    “In that case, Ms. Steinhurst is my father. He drank, squandered money on gifts for us as he squandered money on prostitutes. Now he sits in a tree, a new
    man. He's not new, he's insane, his mind is broken. Now, you can tell him anything you wish, but please leave me for this painting,.”
</p>
<p>
    “No I care and yet respect a man who gave me life, even if the life he gave me was dysfunctional; it was better that none at all.”
</p>
<p>
    “And you know this relative to what? Without ever living, life is inconsequent.”
</p>
<p>
    “Life is a beautiful experience even more so for its end. From death finds life its worth.”
</p>
<p>
    “Life is suffering, and one who begets more life, begets more suffering. Now, please leave me be.” Dante gets up from breakfast and wanders over to the
    river’s edge.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel follows him and grabs Dante’s shoulder, “Dante, plea-“
</p>
<p>
    Dante turns quickly, and slaps his arm away.
</p>
<p>
    “You were always the favorite the Gabriel. You were the lucky one, born first and not blamed for mother’s death!”
</p>
<p>
    “Where did this come from?”
</p>
<p>
    “Leave me alone, Gabriel. This is my journey!”
</p>
<p>
    Dante attempts to push Gabriel in the chest, but Gabriel grabs Dante’s arm, pulls it towards himself, then with his other arm and an open right palm
    strikes Dante in the chest knocking him to the ground. Gabriel kneels down pinning Dante to the ground.
</p>
<p>
    “We both know, Father is a miserable man, and I cannot change that but did just save you. I care about you. Show some respect. I will join you. And the
    painting will go back to father. Are you with me?”
</p>
<p>
    “YES! YES! Just get your hands off of me!”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel released Dante, and they continued for the remainder of the journey in silence. Although faint, three days later a dim light loomed at the horizon,
    like a distant celestial body.
