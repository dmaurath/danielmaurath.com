			<p>The rustle of autumn is the rustle of exasperation, of an end as leaves leave. A long time apart from water they have dried and cracked in the dry cold of approaching winter. A pair of feet on an afternoon’s walk compresses the dried, brittle remains crushing the former ripe leaf, now a lifeless shadow, into folic dust.</p>
			<p>The rustle of spring is an antithesis of the rustle of autumn, and rightly so—it’s a rustle of beginning not end.  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Gaddlgqgo"><em>Frühlingrauschen</em></a> arrives at the dawn of the season, and is the source of the inertia that pushes through the summer. The rustle of people emerging from a winters slumber, from a slow life of early nights and late mornings into a full, energized day. The day enlivened by the sun. Trees enlivened with new crisp green leaves; life sprouts everywhere from the duck’s pond to the feeble crack ignored by the stream of passing soles above.</p>
			<p>In this day of rustling spring, I awaited my future wife, the women from the bakery with the eyes of luscious chocolate, or so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale#Terminology"><em>Märchen</em></a> of a new season had enamored me. We had yet to speak but the glance of a moment was a tome of a lifetime. I needed not more. I had seen a winters snow arrive and recede.</p>
			<p>I waited for her. I picked at the petals of a red rose. I pinched the tip of a petal, gave a tactless tug like that of an inquisitive infant, then released and repeated. Some petals fell to the slight pulls and decorated the cobbled stoned beneath my feet. Soon she should have to accept a stem, and if so, the <em>Märchen</em> of the season had such a hold on me to allow to me believe new petals would without doubt emerge at the moment of her presence. I continued to pick at and accidentally pluck.</p>
	<p>“Buy or move on, this store is not a bus stop!”</p>
	<p>“Come inside, get a broom and sweep the sidewalk if you are going to loiter there all day.”</p>
	<p>“I have an old gramophone in need of some fixing. Nicolas always says that playing music to the streets will bring more customers from the streets. Help an old man out!“</p>
	<p>Everyday Renomme threatened me, or made demands, and requests. He wore his usual disheveled bakers white,  and a delicately hooked mustache upon his wrinkled elder skin long worn by some 50 years in front of a baker’s oven. Yesterday, I had conceived a solution. Today he did not even offer me a glance.</p>
	 <p>Renomme busied himself not with bread, but with Pain, the cat. The endless traffic of questions had bothered me into irrationality. I bought the demented man a cat, more my cat then his. He would never remember to feed or care for it. Not to say he would not want to nor would offer it love, but a cat cannot live on good intentions alone. For now my daily trips to Bakers Lane in hope of meeting the woman prevented an inconvenience. Soon the cat would need a proper home. Maybe Praline, as I had begun to call the mystery women, the schockolade-eyed sphinx, would take the cat. We could raise the cat together, both too old for more children. I already had chosen a name, Pain, short for Pain de Seigle. For the rye is what had brought me back every day. It was the reason I first saw her, and the reason we will first meet one of these days. If only Renomme could remember her!</p>

	 <p>The flower was now a stem.</p>
	 <p>A failed flower!  A failed day! This is madness! I cannot endure much longer. </p>
	 <p> My grip unconsciously loosened and the stem slipped onto the stones. The urge to crush it came to me, to eviscerate it, to spread the green juices in a vicious display of my despair, to diffuse the green blood of life across the cold concrete. I felt the hellish finger penetrate my skull in a flicker. I resisted and bent down to retrieve the stem. Lengthy aged-to-perfection legs blurred in the peripheral of my vision. </p>
	 <p>Praline!</p>
	 <p>I snatched the stem and rose with vigor, but the second of a glance away must have been in an hour on clock of healthy logic, for only Renomme was in the shop. There was a streak of foreign light. </p> 
	 <p>The backdoor was cracked. It was never cracked. </p>
	 <p>I dashed into the store and made little attempt to follow the intent of the maze. My shoulders toppled stack after stack. I hurdled the counter and came crashing down into Renomme, but a week’s worth of bread broke his fall, and his minds video camera, as always, soon ate the tape of this malice. I tripped, stumbled and caught myself on the doorknob, clasping with one hand. My weight and inertia forced it open, as my falling motion turned the knob. I lay on my back, and glanced toward the end of the alley, a moving shadow bended around the corner. With the lean of sprinter I took off from my block. I reached the street, and dug my soles into the ground coming to a wobbly stop before the busy thoroughfare. A mass of people flowed in front of me, but there was no Praline in site. Behind I could hear Renomme shouting at me in French, “. . .fou . .” and behind him Pain chasing something invisible or small, maybe ants. I made a slow return to apologize to Renomme. </p>
	 <p>“I am very sorry Renomme. I thought I saw a women go through this back door. A women I have been waiting to meet for many months.”</p>
	 <p>“This door? No one uses dies door, except my Petite Allemanne”</p>
	 <p>“Excuse me, who?”</p>
	 <p>“My Petite Allemanne.“</p>
	 <p>“You named him after me?”</p>
	 <p>“Ah of course, when you are not here to visit me, Petite Allemanne is equal company. He cannot buy bread, so I only call him after you and not you after him despite the joy he gives me, while you stand in front of my store littering it with dead flowers!”
Renomme went back through the door, clutching an unwilling Petite Allemanne.</p>
	<p>I leaned against the wall and took the loaf I had bought earlier out of my coat. I pulled pieces off to eat as I pulled my thoughts together. The soft lighting emitted a welcoming ambiance in the shop but prevented obvious detection of the ergot growing on the bread. Ergot is a sullied yellow-green, not serene or lively as yellow can be, no, the vulnerable yellow fell victim to unpleasant contamination, like sulfur or mucous.</p>
	<p>With emerging tradition, I tossed the stem that was still in my hand, aside, then soothed another day’s disappointment with some Pain, one I ate, and one who purred with the fit of an engine struggling to life. Pain had escaped Renomme’s clutches. The fitful purr soothed, though it was a sad purr for such a happy cat. Perhaps a sad purr is better for bone strengthening since purring is not emotional expression but a lazy method of increasing bone density for an animal that sleeps 19 hours a day.</p>
	<p>Pain climbed up onto a small ledge to the right and rubbed his head against mine, and I rubbed mine against his. I filled his dish, gave him a goodbye behind-the-ears-scratch and set off towards home.</p> 
	<p>The freewill I gave my mind, to wonder and wander through imagined future years, made me feel nothing but a nauseous doom. An audible monologue progressed in my head.</p>
	<p>The Sunday afternoons, and a new mom for my sons, the woman with the <em>schockolade</em> eyes, were so innocent and beautiful in nature, yet a subconscious voice pawed at the surface. The doom and horror bloated my gut, and I could not escape these feelings. I fought them to a standstill every day I waited for the women, never attaining her, a victory of the subconscious, yet never giving up, a victory for me. My strength finally wavered, beaten down by the narrow loss. I came so close to attain her, closer than I had ever come, but lost her. My sprit was crushed, my Ego victorious. The Id lost.</p>
	<p>Again I collapsed – in a swirl of nausea and confusion. I collapsed not from untreated cancer or epilepsy, but from an unsure idea. My hesitant mind induced my body into a numbing stress. Competing neural programs were gridlocked.</p>
	<p>The woman I saw was but a phantom, like Renomme’s Chaton, an ergotic concoction perhaps: my late wife. Why would she appear? It had been so long. Or was it her? I could no longer recall her form, her beauty. My memories of her were long lost following a nebulous hospital stay, one likely of alcohol but not certain.</p>
	<p>I had wasted a life, lived each day and each day erased by a lack of self-control. My weak mind served the bottle. My wife, she died at the moment of Dante’s birth. She gave her life for him. Her spirit traded his, and always I viewed him with disdain as only half the person she was. He was a parasite that once finished feeding, let his host wither with an ugly convolution of life into the grave. I could never forgive him but could not remember the love which when lost gave justification for the inability to forgive.</p>
