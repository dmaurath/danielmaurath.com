		<p>	"Dante, you devilish boy, unroll that dog this minute!" commanded Ms. Steinhurst.</p>
		<p>	"You object as if you are his counsel. But it is obvious he is asleep and seeks none!”</p>
		<p>"Ah, but if that blanket-wrapped sausage wakes and takes your nose to be a sausage, will you not seek counsel?"</p>
		<p>	"Fine, fine, only a bit of fun with old Pushkin"</p>
		<p>"Old indeed! More respect for your Elders is a point in which you must work on. Where is your brother, Gabriel?"</p>
		<p>"Off in room trying to talk to our dead mother again, no doubt"</p>
		<p>"Must you always speak so tactless?"</p>
		<p>"I am sorry, Madam, but he never plays and I am forever bored without another playmate"</p>
		<p>"Go, go join him, be in company with him for the day, and then you will not be bored nor so black-tongued."</p>
		<p>“But Madam my tongue is pink, or is the well so facetious as to deceive me?”</p>
		<p>“The well does not deceive you. The tongue is black in metaphor. The things you say are dark and as your tongue is the principal facilitator of speech, it must also be dark. Now, do as I say and join your brother.”</p>
		<p>	“Yes, Madam”</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>I, a distinguished but self-absorbed professor of psychology and philosophy, entered this exchange unprepared, my capable mind burdened with internal ideas uninterested in the external. </p>
		<p>“What would you like for dinner doctor?” asked Ms. Steinhurst.</p>
		<p>After a long moment’s hesitation, I replied, “No, no dinner, I ate too much bread at lunch.”</p>
		<p>I made my way from the foyer to relaxation in my study, cigar alit and wine in hand. In residence was a 19th century globe, an ornate chandelier, generous glass bar, large leather chairs, well-placed antique lamps upon antique end tables, paintings of social import, a mammoth antique Ferghan rug atop the centuries old cherry wood floor—it was quite a demonstration of wealth, of success one might say. I sat in my favorite chair, which was well worn from years of erosion by my backside. I relaxed there and considered my Faustian sons who seemed to be my personal genetic representation of a holy war: one devilish and one angelic.  They were yet innocent boys, and in this stage of the story no more evil or angelic than normal. But they were very much on opposite ends of the continuum, bookended by utmost evil and utmost good, left to right or right to left is inconsequent, decide your alignment for the world itself is indecisive. On to musings my mind thrust and the pen followed.</p>
		<div class = "indent">
		<p><em>Patterns govern our existence. Patterns of neurons contrive a vile existence of an ever present “us versus them.” Infants, at three months, see race; it is how they are wired, how the neurons are patterned. The infants grow into adults of frightful affiliation to others of strong but also tenuous connection. From an infantile reflex arises this pattern of connections in an equally infantile goal of defending even spurious relations. A mere perception of relatedness allows us to risk our lives in the name of our brothers or motherland, those bastards of relation in name alone, which reason rejects. Call us a fraternity and we shall die for it. That is a reflex. Automatic. Without thought. </em></p>
		<p><em>Yet I still cry at the cruelty of the beauty of  this us versus them world that I am fit only a few decades for. I aim to perceive everyday in a fuller way: like a shattered mirror reflects light in infinite variety. So, too, do I want to perceive life in infinite variety. To this will is my conscious subservient. To this conscious, wills my will a new portrait of life.  To this will I venture to shatter my life into pieces, to form that new portrait: a mosaic.</em></p>
		<p><em>This will be it named I will not name To name it, would be to arrogate that I could hold such a position.  Instead a description suffices. The will is my contention of my place in an allegorical cave  imprisoned in a society of prisoners who are excluded to mere shadows of existence. I do not have the luxury of free movement like the philosopher, unrestrained by the physical realities of the world. Rather I am imprisoned by the laws of nature, of friction and pressure, of gravity and tension. I am a prisoner not turned towards mere shadows, but towards the source of the shadows. The source is our psychology; the shadows are all that we experience. The shadows are irrational emotions and insufficient thinking, and the prisoners hold them as complete truth.  Knowledge of the external is valued but knowledge of the internal is not. There is no bible for the brain. The collective psychologists and I are writing it. </em></p>
		<p><em>I contend that I as a psychologist am requisite to explain the myriad malfunctions undesired by a rational mind. Cognitive and motivational biases number in the hundreds but few are trained in their recognition. Few can rein in irrational emotion. Few can withhold the impulse to hurt others both physically and materialistically instead of solving the underlying causes. Man goes through the motions of life without ever understanding the basis of life. Man tries. Man ascribes supernatural origins for cognitive processes and even names these origins under an only humanistic ideal of omniscience. And this naming gives rise to conflict between prisoners, for one name must be better than another name. An insult of a name is an insult of the believer, of what they arranged their lives around, of their intelligence, so an insult must be eliminated lest their existence fall to pieces.  I intervene to describe the true source of the shadows but fall victim myself to impulse. I can only educate as much as they listen. </em></p>
		<p><em>Thus, I seek to transcend burdened ways, and live a life unattached to this world of prisoners. To be free I must relinquish all ties to this world. For they are just that, ties, prison restraints that do not allow me to think with my mind completely open and will never let me leave in the fashion that I must.  I must not turn my mind inward and east into a fortress against all that touches skin. I must turn my mind inward and outward and respect the ideas of the future and meditations of the past. </em></p>
		<p><em> I do not consider the eternal cycle to be the Der Sinn des Lebens rather I consider Der Sinn des Lebens ist sterben. Death defines life and definition is meaning. Death is the one source of all pain.  All fear is a derivative of death. All happiness is to laugh at death. All sadness is to remember death. All motivation is to succeed before death. All despair is in the face of death. It reigns as the pinnacle punishment and pinnacle right of immortal honor. Death is not to be sought. If so, all this writing has been fruitless. Rather a life is and must be experienced with death. And this experience is stressful. It is horrible. It is a tearing and clawing experience. It is life. The threat of death grasps the gut. The threat is eternal as I am not. The threat can only be temporarily ignored.  So we must commit to this Drange, to a greater feeling of relief from burden, than any neurochemical reaction our genetics could indirectly create as dopamine released, than any religious order or spirituality has achieved. We must acknowledge that the meaning of life is death, and if it’s purpose you seek, then you seek it all your life, and your purpose becomes all that approached death-</em></p>

		<p>I fell into convulsions, fell out of the chair, fell into a coma as my brain ventured to assess the damage, and recover from the irritation of a self-electrocution; my ranting precipitated and precluded by a flight of frontotemporal epilepsy.</p>
		<p>At any one moment in time (besides those in seizing of course), our brains are poised on the precipice of entropy, manifest as seizure. The fluidity of the metabolic processes of the brain, and the maintenance of the environment necessary for these processes, are held to such exact standards that a single flux in either metabolism or environment yields an act of chaos. A change of blood pH by just 0.10 sends the body spiraling towards the grave, or an organized effort by multiple neuronal networks enabled by constant activation of aspartate and glutamate receptors can —without the inhibition of GABA (the brains ever-watchful chemical conscience) — ripple like a wave in a stadium, through the brain and send me spiraling from my chair. The brain does not tend to entropy, as it has evolved to avoid it at all costs, but does not always succeed.</p>

		<p> Floors and walls bathed in sterile white. My eyes incurred flashes of pain. Infinitesimal barbed photons streaked at a speed of the function of <em>c</em> through my eyelids into my exposed retinas. The pupils shrunk in slow retreat from the borders of my eyes; the pain ebbed.</p>
		<p>Consciousness faded in. It did not turn on like the switch that released the biting light. No, consciousness exists in a continuous state, not a binary one, and in fluid motion slid from oblivion to awareness. </p>
		<p>“Dr. Allemanne can you hear me?”</p>
		<p>“This is Dr. Rotkod from Revelation Hospital. You suffered a seizure.”</p>
		<p>“A seizure, am I brain damaged?” I asked, as I processed complex formulas and concepts in my own self-assessment, “Prime numbers 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. . .Square root of 1,987 is 44.57. . .”</p>
		<p>“No, there was no permanent damage. The seizure was quite mild.”</p>
		<p>	“What could have caused a seizure? I have never had one in my life.” </p>
		<p>Satisfied with my self-assessment, I perused memories of childhood, memories of times fallen and times in hospital. No signs of seizure-derived amnesia here. Everything seems well. </p>
		<p>“It was caused by Ergotism we believe.”</p>
		<p>“And what is Ergotism?”</p>
		<p>“It is a poison caused by ingestion of ergot, a rye fungus.”</p>
		<p>“I have never heard of that.”</p>
		<p>“But you have likely heard of the result of ergotism, if untreated. It is the same disease that originated the idea of witches and subsequent deluded hunts for them in Salem. Hunters glimpsed the supernatural from an anomaly of neurochemistry, but did not see it in a vicious god, rather in certain women.”</p>
		<p>“Have you eaten any rye lately?” asked his curious nurse.</p>
		<p>In a fit of scatterbrain, I had ingested a piece of bread bought earlier than my mental model of the world had attributed thus acquiring the disease, or so my associates hypothesized. My peers and family in response to the sudden onset of my hermetic behavior adopted ergotism as an appropriate diagnosis. Only a disease associated with hallucinations, convulsions and other afflictions of the mind could cause me to relieve myself of all possessions and then in that end, also meet my end, as a living, breathing entrapped human, or so at least society dictates. However, it was not a simple infection that led to such a dramatic shift in my life’s work; it could not have been. The ergot plays an influence throughout this story, but at that time of such enlightenment I assure you I was free, and influenced by something greater. I believe it to have been something much greater, something that Anthony was in ally with. With the loss of that piece of art, I was not expressing an indirect wish of the infection, but my farewell to a reliance on objects of affection from which to derive myself through introspection. It was something of a great but so easily translucent power I served in that cavernous tree, until that final possession of mine was found, then sold, thereby allowing me to exasperate into bliss!</p>
		<p>Dr. Rotkod’s voice reeled me in from atemporal tangents, "Good news is that you are stable now and will make a full recovery from the ergotism.”</p>
		<p>“Terrific news. Am I free to leave? I must get back to my office. I have not had a drink in ages.”</p>
		<p>“You were here only a day, Sir. That is hardly a long time to be missing a drink. In fact you will be required to miss a drink for much longer.”</p>
		<p>“For how long? On what grounds doctor? A bit of ergot cannot take away a man’s tolerance! I’d say if anything, I’m stronger now for having survived.”</p>
		<p>“I am afraid we have some bad news. During our tests we discovered something serious.” </p>
		<p>He paused to let me prepare for the worst. The visual cortex gave me a slideshow in seconds of everything my imagination could conceive would come out of his mouth.</p>
		<p>“You should never have another single drink. You have a tumor developing in your liver. It appears stable for now, but in the coming weeks it will only become worse. The tumor is inoperable.”</p>
		<p>“Inoperable. Surely you could at least try, no?”</p>
		<p>“The tumor has assimilated into the liver. To remove it would mean removing the entire liver and at your age a transplant is not feasible.” </p>
		<p>“What about treatment?”</p>
		<p>“The presumably high alcohol diet has restricted the tumor’s growth somewhat, but any known drugs will also kill the liver. The assimilation is simply too far. We can begin treatment and pain management, but we can only realistically hope for another year.”</p>
		<p>“There is nothing else you can do?”</p>
		<p>“No, I am afraid we can only provide small doses of very targeted radiation in hopes of killing the tumor cells, but not the healthy liver cells.”</p>
		<p>“I read often about stem cells. Couldn’t you regrow any of the dead cells?”</p>
		<p>“No the studies are still inconclusive. The treatment has been very inconsistent in rats, and humans add another thick layer of complexity.”</p>
		<p>I had distracted myself with questions I knew the answer to. I had difficulty accepting this news, as anyone would. The end always seems a worry of the far future, yet years creep in without the knowledge of that perspective. The  perspective becomes unknowingly outdated until confronted by the harshness of life. </p>
		<p>“There is another option.”</p>
		<p>The doctor’s curious porosity broke my meditation. </p>		
		<p>“There is an experimental treatment in development here at this hospital that has passed all animal trials and has begun human trials. My colleagues are seeking out volunteers for the procedure. The procedure is called:  Selective Memory Eradifiction.TM </p>		
		<p>“Selective memory eradication? You can erase my memory selectively? Is this a new procedure? What does memory have to do with the liver?”</p>		
		<p>“It's a very new procedure invented by my colleagues Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak who work in research here at the hospital. It is an alternative we hope to offer our terminal patients in lieu of typical pain management regiments, or currently illegal assisted suicides. We will erase your knowledge of the terminal disease, including for example the conversation we are having now, and every hour spent here.</p>
		<p>“The latter sounds brilliant!” I interject. </p>		
		<p>“Um…yes… you will leave this office without a single coherent memory of anything that has happened. You will believe to have been subject to an ordinary physical, nothing else.”</p>
		<p>“But I will leave still only months from death? And what about the pain? The complications of the disease? Won’t they just return me here?”</p>		
		<p>“Intelligent observation. Erasure of memory of course is not a cure. However there is an extended placebo effect, as we refer to it in the lab. By being unaware of the disease, the symptoms are ignored by the body. Ignorance of the disease lessens psychological stress, which impairs the immune system.  It is a phenomenon we still seek an explanation for. For an unknown reason a loss of awareness produces this effect, but the absence does not. A patient pre-diagnosis then will suffer despite not knowing what it is they suffer from, while a patient post diagnosis, who has no more conscious knowledge of his condition does not suffer. Well actually what if it is sub. . .” The doctor lowered his voice to a murmur as he stared off into space lost in his own musings. With a jolt of sudden self-awareness, snapped back to consciousness. “So, your choices are hospice or perhaps a year more of happiness from SME<sup>TM</sup>."</p>
		<p>I chose SME<sup>TM</sup>. I chose to forget the diagnosis and to live my last few weeks as well as I could.  I did this for my sons. I exchanged a longer life potential for the ability to give my sons more memories, better memories, memories of trips, eye-opening conversations and my pride in them. Cancer will not plague even the slightest remembrance of me. Their memory will not suffer due to my suffering. The neurons that can in a miracle of design express father will not be forever entwined with those that express cancer and the inevitable flood of emotions attached to it. Cancer will not be remembered, and the past must be better flavored.  I exchanged my memories for their memories. I exchanged their forthcoming life, for their past life. Their past life had been that which in memory only brought melancholy. They had only seen me through the distorted gloom of a brown bottle, and I had only seen them after the bottle. A brain resembles a sponge, and mine had been one, withholding naught but alcohol and contempt. </p>		
		<p>All things coveted are of earth and of earth only comes pain. I must empty my life of earth, and prepare to live.  I must give my sons all the potential memories in the hours of the weeks that followed, and ingrain in them the knowledge of a dead man. I had to forget all that led me to this epiphany, so I did, and so such a fairy tale death was possible. My apprehensive reader, you may doubt my euphemistic description, but in this current relationship I hold all the information, and in time smirking revelation will become you, and you will realize the magic of my untragic last breath. </p>
