	<div class="content">
<p>
    A few days had passed without any visitors, other than those who brought me my dried fruit or water. I had been in the tree for two weeks now. My limbs
    began to feel stiff and my body rooted into the sleeping plot I had carved out. Movement became laborious.
</p>
<p>
    I hear a piercing whistle.
</p>
<p>
    “Dante?” I thought, “but so soon?”
</p>
<p>
    Indeed it was too soon. Instead it was Dr. Samekh strolling across the grounds to the tree, whistling that aggravating tone Dante had taught him.
</p>
<p>
    “Knock, Knock, wake up dear Sir!” Dr. Samekh unlike his typical mild self beat against the hollowed tree with his bare knuckles and worn brown boots.
</p>
<p>
    I shook my head to test reality. Perhaps it was Dante and my memories were mixing.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ve been awake quite some time, please no more whistling. I thought Dante had returned to throttle a poor old man again.”
</p>
<p>
    “I have an important story to share today.”
</p>
<p>
    “So Mikhail has changed his tactics and is now paying you not to avoid me but dull me further into insanity?”
</p>
<p>
    “Mikhail has no influence over me. I had business to attend to, many clients to attend to. Life is known to trigger a wide range of mental affliction that
    only a skilled doctor can reconcile.”
</p>
<p>
    As he eased into his seat outside my tree, I saw through the wrecked porthole that he had not knocked on my tree with worn boots, but new boots, Mikhail’s
    boots. I knew them well, as they were all I could usually see during our many reluctant meetings held from my tree.
</p>
<p>
    “Often I wish I had the strength to be a hermit like you,” said Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “I am hardly a hermit, but would appreciate your help with changing that.”
</p>
<p>
    “I always encounter the most vacuous individuals. A young female acquaintance complimented me on my new boots this morning, but I did not thank her with
    reciprocation so she chastised me for my rudeness. I told her that her self-esteem should be built on firmer ground and not rely on an acquaintance’s
    flattery. She did not enjoy that one bit. That does make any sense to one who is self-aware of their irrationality. We educate our children on how to use
    the brain but not on how to maintain it, which is a gross oversight I believe. Anyway, what did you say? Oh, yes, the boots. They were a gift of Mikhail
    and remind me of the boots of my adoptive fathers when I was homeless boy.”
</p>
<p>
    “When were you homeless?”
</p>
<p>
    “Like I said, as a boy. I was orphaned at a young age and lived with my aunt and uncle. My uncle worked at a small bank in our Carpathian village that
    produced hard currency. Our village was small and too far from a city to have large sums of money reliably and safely transported. So my father ran a coin
    press. He melted the gold, copper, nickel, zinc, and silver sourced from local mines, poured it into the molds and then once cooled we would have new
    currency.
</p>
<p>
    Well being a precocious child, I quickly learned the importance of money and came to despise its control over everyone’s life. My uncle had labored so hard
    in my short 8-year life, all for money. He shed tears and hair, all for money. For that I hated money. Life is more than little gold pieces. I hated money
    so much I came to consider it evil, and sought to destroy it.
</p>
<p>
    Every 10 years my uncle had to collect all the currency in our small village, count it and compare it to his ledgers. In this way, missing or lost currency
    was replaced every 10 years. Around my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday the decennial coin replacement took place.
</p>
<p>
    My uncle stored the currency in a basement one could enter from steps behind a false wall in his study. I entered the basement one late night, and stole
    all the currency. I dragged it sack by sack to the yard. My village was very small so we had but a few bags. Once I had collected it all, I loaded it onto
    my small wagon, hitched my mule and made for the Lucithian Bridge—a massive, 1000-year old stone bridge that spanned a deep and treacherous ravine. There I
    tossed every last coin, every last source of evil in my microscopic world, into the rocky depths below. The coins flooded over the stones. Moonlight
    reflected upon thousands of shiny faces. After the coins, I tossed the dozens of molds, which cracked and splintered into pieces on the jagged rocks.
</p>
<p>
    The next day I confessed all I had done openly to my uncle. He smacked me, and spit at me, and disowned me as his son. I had ruined him! I thought he would
    be happy, free to spend some time with me. Money spoke that I day I still believe, not my uncle. I struggled to explain that I only wanted happiness.. But
    he wouldn’t listen. He only spit and shouted, like a cornered animal.
</p>
<p>
    The villagers wanted death, my head for the thousands of headed coins I’d destroyed, for had I not only destroyed the economy but I defaced the emperor,
    our lord on high. Some villagers attempted to hike down to the ravine and retrieve the coins, but all fell and joined their dear lifeless heads.
</p>
<p>
    My gracious aunt spared me death, in place of exile. I rode back with my uncle to the city for an emergency supply of currency and new molds. But did not
    take the return trip. He tossed me out onto the streets with only the clothes I had on and I never saw my family again. My aunt had slipped me some sweets
    I hid in my pockets.
</p>
<p>
    For the first few days I wandered the streets. The sweets my aunt gave me melted in my pocket. I moistened my finger with my lips, rubbed it along the
    inside the pocket and then stuck it into my mouth to taste something again. I ate apple rinds, bread crusts, the little bits of fat that cling stubbornly
    to the bone – anything everyone throws away. When that rubbish could not satiate a growing boys hunger, I stole from the market stands and from the pockets
    of strangers with my nimble small hands. My life had become that of an animal always trying to solve the mystery of its next meal.
</p>
<p>
    After a few days that passed as weeks, the chocolate melting sun subsided in favor of dense wet clouds weighed down by the millions of droplets
    constituting them. Clouds hovered dispensing their immense volume a drop at a time over the city, until they dissipated into a billowy grey storm on the
    horizon.
</p>
<p>
    I awoke to the sensation of cold heavy drops splattering across my face at midday. Sleeping during the night was too unsafe, and at night is when all the
    restaurants and shops tossed their unwanted spoils to the curb, to my plate. The rain began to pour.
</p>
<p>
    I rushed up out of my alley, down towards the main thoroughfare Reganplatz. I crossed through the others running from a fright of rain and associated
    discomfort of sopping clothes, and into a small clock shop.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey you there!” the old shopkeeper called out, “You’re the lad that was caught sleeping in front of me store. No boy sleeping on the streets can afford a
    clock. Now go away, I don’t want any trouble. “
</p>
<p>
    I went back out into the now torrential rain.
</p>
<p>
    “The market was nearby and had awnings. I could dry off there.” I thought.
</p>
<p>
    I ran to the market, but immediately was chased off by another old but sprite Farmer McKenzie, to whom I owed at least three of my last meals.
</p>
<p>
    Afraid of catching a whiff of his cane with my skull, I sprinted down the thoroughfare and took a blind turn right down an alley, which turned right into
    another alley and then dead-ended at another perpendicular alley, at which I turned left, ran aside a narrow brick wall, then turned into a slight curve
    which dropped down under an old mill rising with a set of short steep steps into yet another concealed alleyway that split into three directions. I
    continued straight, turned left, right, and then left again. Finally I emerged from the labyrinth to a view of warmth and excitement. The train station.
    Only once had I been there on a family trip to visit a dying Uncle or was it a cousin? Anyway, I hurried into the shelter and solitude of a bustling train
    station, where everyone is too self-occupied to notice a small, hungry boy, utterly confused with the world.
</p>
<p>
    I sat on a bench in the lobby and caught my breath. Despite the excitement my brain was foggy, not all circuits were operational.
</p>
<p>
    “Would you like something to eat?” I heard this but did not process it because I did not attend to it. Sure it went into my ears and my brain interpreted
    the pattern of sounds as meaningful language, but I never assigned that sound of “you” to my conception of self. Not until I heard it again, and a little
    louder this time.
</p>
<p>
    “You look miserable in those wet clothes, can I get you some dry ones and a bite to eat?” asked a woman, I’d say middle-aged now, but at the time,
    “motherly” dressed for church and bending at the waist to meet my eyes.
</p>
<p>
    I didn’t say a word.
</p>
<p>
    She stepped closer and her calm demeanor masked assertions as requests. She told me she would take me and to follow her. She stood there with her
    white-gloved hand out. I hesitated until my stomach growled – a tumbling of air in the gut. A boy cannot grow on air, not like a tree can.
</p>
<p>
    My muddied hand ruined her pristine glove, but her reaction was flat. She fed me, clothed me, and passed the time of her layover with a human doll. She
    wished I could join her on the train, but she explained how her husband, the cynic, never wanted children. He expressed a desire to do his part in ending
    cumulative and convergent human encouragements of nature’s recovery of itself from humans.
</p>
<p>
    Tears welled in her eyes until she closed her lids and repressed the tears for what seemed a countless time. When her train boarded, she gave me a kiss on
    the cheek, shoved cash into my front pocket and fixed my collar,
</p>
<p>
    “Goodbye, sweet boy,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    She waved goodbye to me from the train, her gloves white again.
</p>
<p>
    Later that week another young couple with two children of their own woke me from my nap in the back corner of the lobby. They wanted to help me find my
    parents. I said I didn’t have any to find.
</p>
<p>
    The woman’s sweet words coaxed me from my nest of newspapers and forgotten clothes. Her husband bought me and the other children corn dogs and then ice
    cream. They asked me also to join them on their train.
</p>
<p>
    I ate my ice cream bites, not savory licks. I ravaged it as a beast that cares not for taste, only for the fulfillment of a meal. Their son was only a few
    licks into his cone. Finished with mine, I tried to scoop a bit off the side with my finger, but he caught me and bit down onto my finger, hard. I smacked
    him to let go as his mother turned around. She ripped me to the side by the collar, and I winced beneath a bombarding scolding.
</p>
<p>
    For months I lived usually a homeless wretch but occasionally a potential son. I ruined every chance I had in time due to an inherent distrust in anyone
    offering me love. After all my parents offered me love. True a couple families I did live with for quite awhile, but those were families of convenience.
    Tired of the streets, I’d rather accept some unsolicited love than fight another beast or bum for the scraps of travelers.”
</p>
<p>
    His story reached an abrupt end that preceded only a moment of precious silence.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh’s voice changed to a commanding and confident tone. Like a flip of a switch, all he had said was erased and a new subject discussed.
</p>
<p>
    “I have a business idea, and I think you’re the man to do it?”
</p>
<p>
    I peaked through my crack, and there speaking was only the fraud.
</p>
<p>
    He continued without hesitation, “So do you want to hear it? No you’ll want to hear it. I will open a clinic where dreams are interpreted.”
</p>
<p>
    “A true businessman never reveals his ideas too soon. I’m afraid you would make the worst entrepreneur. Now, please leave my friend here alone and stop
    imitating me,” said Mikhail as he approached me, my tree Mikhail had returned with an apology and rack of fresh bread.
</p>
<p>
    “I will have Sven repossess those boots this minute if you do not leave Dr. Samekh. Dr. Allemanne needs less, not more, insanity. Now, Dr. Allemanne I
    really meant you no stress earlier. I will leave you this fresh bread here, from Maurá a former protégé of Renomme, but only if you give me all the bread
    you have inside there in return.
</p>
<p>
    “I am no beggar, I choose this life, and this bread sustains me well. I will not waste it.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail tore off a piece from one of the loaves, “Here try this. If you do not take it, it will be wasted.”
</p>
<p>
    He shoved his bread-filled hand through the small opening in the tree. I hesitated then snatched it. I placed it into my mouth and chewed and tasted
    deliberately.. I had forgotten what I was missing. The flavor, the moisture, the texture, all in perfect balance.
</p>
<p>
    “Now will you take it or should I leave it to spoil in the coming rains here in the yard?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, no, no I will take it, please pass it in here.”
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail passed the bread through the mangled entrance, and then departed, not wanting to test his luck too far in winning anymore battles today. At last I found peace to transcribe my chaotic writings.
