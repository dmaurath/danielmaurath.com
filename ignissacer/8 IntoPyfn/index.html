<p>
    Dr. Samekh returned with a woman, a familiar face, Martina Bauer. Their voices expressed turbulence of argument, but too far way to hear until upon my
    tree, Martina said the final word and hurried away, “Your wit oft pricks the veneer of society, Samekh, but that wit pricks oft also your friends."
</p>
<p>
    Curious I asked, “What was that about?”
</p>
<p>
    “Such a smart girl, but muddles her magnificent mind in religion. She acts like those poor and uneducated, susceptible to command and myopia. Her ideas are
    flotadorian.”
</p>
<p>
    “Do you not hold any beliefs Samekh? I find solace in the idea of a designer, of an afterlife through an eternal soul, of something greater than myself,
    beyond this stale existence. The reassurance of the sheer fleeting essence of the terrors of nature, of the cruelty of a life defined by omnipresence of
    death.”
</p>
<p>
    “As all innately believe, yet life cannot be so easy, the product of infantile intuitions. A baby can recognize the pattern of lines that comprise a face,
    its innate. But the pattern-finding mind is overzealous, seeing patterns where they do not exist. These intuitions are only a simple solace. Opiate to the
    masses, Marx said, though I do not believe that all religions are opiates. Many offer lifelong terror and worry over the slightest deviation, or are
    concerned with the absolute mundane such as being buried with impractical worldly possessions without ever addressing the quintessential question of
    existence. But I offer answer in the potential of science, which does not punish for wrong assumptions and always remains up to date. In science, we are
    the product of randomness, of pressure and time, not of a merging of soul and body. Your religious soul is just a confusion of the connection between mind
    and body. Consciousness, that which encompasses all our memories, hopes, dreams, wants and needs, all of our mental life, is firmly rooted in the neural
    processes biology. You found a pattern of a designer where there is none and that pattern matches the constructs of your culture as the Hindu god matches
    their culture. The physicalist gaps filled by nonphysicalist agents to complete a more simple understanding of the world at the expense of truth, a
    frightening truth that is we will never know answer to the quintessential question.”
</p>
<p>
    “But this sense of a soul feels right. My brain is the tool of my existence, but separate from I. I tell my brain what to do, and it does it. <em>I</em> am
    my eternal soul. ”
</p>
<p>
    “The eternal <em>I</em> is only because you fear death, which leaves you susceptible to a dire hope for an immorality, an immortality where the I
    continues. But this all the result of infantile intuitions of grand delusion that leads to a notion of two separate worlds, one of us, of <em>I</em>, and
    one of all that is <em>not I,</em> physical objects. The physical is predictable, the psychological random. This is fundamental to human thought and
    arises in babies of religious families or not. If fundamental then, how can it be not true? I here have escaped the fundamentalism, thus it cannot be true.
    Just because something is natural does not mean its right. Do you succumb to all natural urges? No. It requires only a little work to escape. From here we
    are led to believe that humans, a petty species on an insignificant planet in a galaxy far removed from the center of anything other than our own
    delusions, will live on a place reflective of our insignificant lives. That heaven, hell or another parallel world—described with such richness of its
    cultural context as a respite from an industrious existence—is our end goal. It’s not. Far more difficult to reconcile is the finality of existence.
    Finality the brain cannot comprehend. Its not you, its your biology. Here I offer a key to a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate the key but fear the fear of facing the unknown. And while I have no desire to make false claims, I still want to believe and find a place
    for science among my beliefs, but do not ascribe all to science. Science proposes as ridiculous of a solution to our origin as any religion. From where
    does it all come from? How could the genius of this tree be by chance? To respire, a tall tree lowers its internal pressure tens of times below that of the
    earth’s by evaporating water through nanoscale pores, sucking it up over 100 meters in a state where it should boil but yet does not, because the xylem
    tubes carrying the water contain no air bubbles, they never have. And all of this is done to capture a few mere molecules of carbon dioxide.”
</p>
<p>
    “A tree is magnificent but cannot time be your god? Again you fall victim to shortsightedness. Questions of what and when and who are limited by our
intelligence and restriction to three dimensions. Like Flatlanders, our physical limitations prevent us from seeing the complete picture.    <em>From what?</em> First we need an answer for what, “what” is. <em>From when?</em> Time is derivative of the presence and absence of light coupled with
    mortality. <em>From who?</em> Inherently we are programmed to ascribe agency to the complex, and so naturally ascribe a creator to the brilliant inventor
    of science. We see an intricate web but cannot conceive of the spider. Agency, always detected, is convenient in the leisure of storytelling, where a tree
    can emote or a sheep make plans; it allows clever immersion and suspension of disbelief but in the end betrays us in higher-thought. We cannot comprehend
    the near infinite probabilities of it rising from nothing. We find gods in toast and wall drains. We find succubae in the shadows and signals in static. We
    are the fault of our incredibly effective and efficient pattern finder. We are wired to expect human characteristics in objects and events, which
    precipitates animism and from that fault, all religions emerge.”
</p>
<p>
    “Is saying we will never know not itself a superficial answer?
</p>
<p>
    “We, humans, will one day know if we can survive the quarrels caused by our propensity to find patterns, but we, you and I, will not know. Our
    consciousness will depart with our biology long before we reach that pinnacle of existence.”
</p>
<p>
    “Does that not frighten you, the fear of the unknown?”
</p>
<p>
    “Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear, and only a liar claims otherwise. As Dostoevsky said, “Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people
    fear most." I fear it as much you, but find dignity in facing it without consolation, and see your monkish existence as a surrender and coward’s effort to
    staunch the fear.”
</p>
<p>
    “I find the monks to be quite welcoming and hospitable.”
</p>
<p>
    “Provided you do not retake your donation, or violate one of their norms. They have incurred the painful initiation of losing forever their freedom. They
    dress the same, act the same, eat the same, speak the same, sing the same, worship the same not for orthopraxy, that clever guise of persuasion, but to
    maintain an in-group or fraternity of group solidarity. A brotherhood predicated on internalized false notions of genetic relatedness. Violate the norms
    and you will be banished, exiled away from the hospitality they preach.”
</p>
<p>
    “The monks would never be so harsh.”
</p>
<p>
    “One could find out, but not an experiment I wish to undertake. I envy your position of adamant belief. My torturous questioning of every tradition, of
    every belief, of every truth and thought is tiring. I fear sleep because I fear my undistracted mind.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will pray for you Samekh, that the peace I seek, you may also seek.”
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate it in my heart even if my head finds it futile.”
</p>
<p>
    “You are welcome.”
</p>
<p>
    I have another appointment with a client now and must not keep him waiting. He is a renowned neuroscientist and author struggling with the tragic death of
    his first pet.
</p>
<p>
    “I will pray for him as well. Goodbye Samekh.”
</p>
<p>
    “Until we meet again” replied Samekh as I heard him stand and depart.
</p>
<p>
    Samekh had never been so lucid or contemplative. He had shown an unknown side of his personality. I wonder what other sides he concealed.

    Burnt candle wax, autumn is here. An acrid air of burning wood, the autumnal chill fog infects every crevice of the cobbled town. Candles burn early now
    and earlier each day. The burnt wax wafts — so nostalgic, it's the winter's allure.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel rides through town and the houses blur on his periphery as perception bends at a constant value dependent on speed.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel clops through to the edge of this town (the abstract boundary realized by the amiable roots of the first Pyfn Forest trees). The town stretches
    below like grey blight over the craggy valley. The harsh artificial lights blind the stars. Gabriel turns his back.
</p>
<p>
    Before him is a cathedral of forest. Trees so tall, in such planned splendor that their dense branches sprout late and bend into an esoteric <em>centréal</em>. The
    ground is a carpet of moss. The air dense like the trees hovers as a cloud. Light reflects off of the cloud and obfuscation is born. He reads a sign at the
    forest's edge, “Ich sehe nicht mehr den Wald vor lauten Gebäuden.”
