<p>
    Gamut, a distinguished man aged like a good ale, wore a speckled beard of dark and light shades that wrapped around the back of his balding wrinkled head.
    Beneath a long nose with rounded nostrils stretched the neat beard like a triangle to the ovular jawline. His eyes were dark but kind, and his heart
    palpitated with excitement. He had returned to Halvemaen—the city of his formative years as an architect—to visit the first building he designed: a
    library called the Halvemaen Bibliothek.
</p>
<p>
    	<div class="dividerimg">

		</div>
</p>
<p>
    Gamut arrived at the location of the Halvemaen Bibliothek and believed himself lost. Absent were excited children, old men napping beneath half-read
    newspapers, intellectuals and their pseudo counterparts conversing over coffee —all his memories of the place reconsolidated into an unrealistic fiction.
    He wanted to blame the present and long for an idyllic past, but idyllic is and always will be a naïve fiction. The past was a present no better than the
    present.
</p>
<p>
    Before him decayed a forgotten structure that expressed the passage of time like Gamut’s worn face. Defaced boards replaced the ornate stained glass of the
    windows, and a missing roof subjected the insides to the maladies of the elements. Distraught, he neared the building trying to comprehend the disconnect
    between memory and reality, caressed the tired stone as one does the rigid body of a coffined loved one. New connections formed, but a piece of Gamut died.
    He retreated to one of the numerous pubs to crudely rewire his emotions.
</p>
<p>
    Gamut new better. He had left Halvemaen for the reasons that destroyed the library, which had become a prized memory now short-lived and swimming in
    alcohol. He had been driven away by the artistic constraints of building meretricious churches, redundant malls and foul-bricked pubs with substandard
    materials matching the vulgarity of their society. He had to slog through everyday, contending with an idealess manager, whom always demanded but never
    thought. At Gamut’s departure to the unknown of Terenverde, he left this note:
</p>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	<em>
        I had not pleasure of working together, unless in precedent a man can derive in congruence both feelings of pleasure and immense pain, but immense pain
        is all I recall, absent all pleasure from pain. Repressed perhaps the pleasure lies, but distress is all that exists beyond repressed to my waking
        mind. I venture to a front unstressed, an accumulation anterior an abrupt avalanche, the avalanche my future foreseen. To prevent thus and play a trick
        with time, I submit this novel rhyme as my two weeks notice, notice and embrace, erase all trace from mind, for I just yet erased thine.
	</em>
	</p>

<p>
    He entered a full pub; it was another sports day. He found a seat at the bar, ordered a beer, but the seat was not his to take. That circle of space had
    been conquered in the name of Peir Gerlofs, a local poacher.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey old man, get out of my seat!” demanded the pugnacious poacher.
</p>
<p>
    “It was empty when I arrived, no drink or name had indicated it was taken. Besides, it’s the bar’s seat,” replied Gamut with the calm of self-control.
</p>
<p>
    “Hey, smart ass, that’s my seat, these girls here were supposed to watch it for me,” Peir Gerlofs pointed to two female clones harboring not a single
    unique thought or idea among them.
</p>
<p>
    “And they failed at even that task. This is my seat now. Another will open up soon, I am sure. Or maybe you can pull one from a table. This is not an
    offense worthy of such hostility.”
</p>
<p>
    “No, this is MY seat so LEAVE or we can take this outside. I will not be disrespected in front of these girls!” Gerlofs shouted.
</p>
<p>
    Gamut remained stoic.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you even understand the words and thoughts you express? Why become so instantly stressed and angry for such trivialities as seats and honor? Honor is
    just a word, an invention, and only lingers out of pluralistic ignorance — everyone believes everyone else believes it exists. No reason then to invite
    violence for trifling matters such as the momentary owner of a seat.”
</p>
<p>
    “Or we can settle it here,” Peir threatened. .
</p>
<p>
    Gamut’s words fell on dumb ears, but he pressed on, “I admire your proactive display, your unhesitating will to impress a fearful reputation, but I am not
    here to challenge you or that fragile reputation. I am here to sit.”
</p>
<p>
    “You can sit on the floor,” said Peir as he gave Gamut a shove.
</p>
<p>
    “Your impulsivity blinds you to the reductio ad absurdum of your actions. Consider this. Your tough act is defense of your honor, which is presumed needed
    to impress a mate, derived from a presumed universal goal of winning the absolute best mate, that goal of winning the best mate derived from presumed
    pleasure of being with that mate, that conquering exhilarating pleasure derived from a rewards system, derived from chemical impulses, derived from an ion
    exchange. You see, all this anger and hostility is only a chemical exchange, so lets exchange chemicals, and not bloody fists. What are you drinking? I’ll
    buy you a drink.”
</p>
<p>
    Peir, lost at “your” reoriented at “buy you a drink,” could only say, “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
    The tense impasse disintegrated from challenge of dominance into a sign of friendship. Peir and Gamut cheersed two glasses of ale, and then Gamut left his
    seat and the pub to Peir Gerlofs.
