		<p>I exited the house onto Vidrar Way, a few (thousand) select neurons short. Memories of dreams unnerved me in the early morning. I went for a walk unaware of my impending death bar a subtle trembling recessed in the sub-conscience.  Dr. Rotkod had mentioned the potential for faint holdover, which may explain the bizarre coincidence of the simultaneous end of my life and my last imprint on the local economy, but not that I would ever remember the conversation. I relay this now with omniscience granted by the passing of life.</p>

		</div>
		<p>I continued in such detached concentration that it was far too late by the time I realized I had missed my turn off of Vidrar Way. I came upon the wonderful smells of Bakers Lane; a unique section of the town not secluded to a single ethnicity and culture but to baking. The breads, pies, cookies here were the best in the region perhaps the world. I never traveled any farther than a bottle begged, but came here often enticed by the nostalgia of my childhood and memory of my father.</p>
		<p>A wonderful memory is a voice, my father’s voice. A voice that always read aloud my favorite story, a clever tale about a knight:</p>
		<p></p>
		<div class="indent">
		<p><em>Once upon a time there was a Knight who had to prepare for a dangerous battle with the foulest of trolls in the land of Rheinmark. He had faced many enemies, and was often victorious. He had slain dragons and kings. But the stories of the Troll's terror frightened him. The Troll placed his victims in burning pots of stew or ate them alive limb by limb. The Knight decided that he could not lose his honor in any other manner other than death. He would face death for that is the code of Knights. Now, we have the pleasure of meeting that brave Knight </em></p>
		<p><em>I placed my suit of armor on and after a hesitation left the house. A poor beggar in rags sat outside my door in the alley. He threatened all who passed near him. I approached him and invited him to my life’s end, and explained that I must fight the most powerful Knight in the land.  “Your life’s end is already here!” he threatened, as he attacked me with an iron blade. I grabbed at his wrist, but fell victim to the unpredictability of the beginner. His iron blade slipped under my shoulder plate and into fragile flesh. All the worry over the battle vanished with the intense pain. Anger flashed quickly through my veins and in seconds I had the beggar by the throat following a swift thrust of his pitiful self into the stonewall.  The irony, I thought, that through the iron of a beggar I almost meet my life’s end.</em></p>
		</div>
		<p>I remember my father took me often to a place with the most ambrosial bread. Tasting that bread ruined a man. All other loaves were insipid bricks.</p>
		<p><em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em> was nestled in the cobbled corners of the quarter, where crowds of tourists, locals and jealous bakers jostled for the loaves of scare supply. My father had grown up with Renomme in Bakers Lane, and worked his first job with Renomme at <i>La Boulangerie</i>.He would still help Renomme on occasion so we never had to wait.</p>
		<p>I was a precocious baker and baked my own bread with Patrice, Renomme’s sister, while my father helped with the baking and chatted with Renomme. Renomme rarely had time for chatting since many a sniveling bake would buy one of each loaf to discern its secrets (imported French seed grown on a family farm) and many tourists made <em>La Boulangerie du Renomme</em> their number one stop in the smallish city of Halvemaen.</p>
		<p>Flour hung in the air like morning fog over coastal bridges, and lightened the dark features of my father. The pace was fast but not in the sense that it was rushed, rather purposeful and enveloped in the joviality of a man doing what he loved, baking, and another doing what he truly loved, living. This was a cherished memory, and one of a collection of memories of my father, which I could never replicate with my own sons. </p>
		<p>I did not love living. I loved numbing and excluding myself from living. I filtered life out with alcohol and gave my sons a collection of scars, not memories.</p> 
		<p>As a small child, I thought I was the only person to in one instant wish horrific death on an innocent dog licking my face, then an instant later be in tears for having considered such a wretched act.I remember my father’s revelation to me of the prevalent flickers of horrific thoughts, of the intrusive thoughts as I came to learn about them in my psychological study.</p>
		<p>We encircled Serpent Lake in Hyde Park during a final trip to London, the eve of my father’s final battle with brain cancer. My father was a vehement Psychoanalyst, but the gentlest and most calming man I know. His voice was an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9RgbGLLfE">Arvo Pärt symphony</a>, at all times a eulogy, full of hope and security. It was with that voice of a rabbit resting he spoke to me the day before he died.</p>
		<p>“Throughout life you will face terrible attacks from the inner demons. They will come in many forms, and defy your internal fortifications. One form is most despicable. Impulse will pray on a natural defense. His finger alit with fire and smoke will probe into your mind and inject in an instant thoughts and desires only the extremity of evil could conceive. You must never follow these desires even if they appear endemic orders. Learn to immediately block them out of mind and shut the door on impulsive meddling.”</p>
		<p>In an instant he was dead. The following day he never awoke. Time may have pacified the <em>friedliche Sprache</em> but the voice survives in memory. Only through my memory and I, he survives. I could not deny my sons similar memories. I could not deny myself immortality by continuing to test their threadbare loyalty, less cared for than my Ferghan. </p>
