<p>
    The trembles in Pyfn were followed neither by urgent news nor black smoke of obvious warning, but trembles of the mind, ooofff mmmyyy hhaannnddsss, oofff
    mmyy ennttiirrree boOdDdDdDdDy.
</p>
<p>
    Spit rolled out over my lip and down my face. I discovered this afterwards, as my neurons of tactician conspired with the entirety of my brain in its brief
    fit of arrhythmia.
</p>
<p>
    Like a fireworks show mistimed to music, my brain fired and fired in a brilliant trembling asynchronous display.
</p>
<p>
    Slooowwwyyy ttthhe ttrrembles stopped.
</p>
<p>
    “Another seizure. You should see a doctor, a medical doctor,” said Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    He had witnessed the entire episode.
</p>
<p>
    I wiped the spit from my mouth, “I have.”
</p>
<p>
    “I said a medical doctor.”
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Bartle and Dr. Zotak have been educated the most esteemed of institutions.”
</p>
<p>
    “Intelligence and hard work does not rule out amorality. Aristotle taught me that one in his Ethics while I played dog to the unethical”
</p>
<p>
    “Aristotle must have also taught you then to be a magnanimous man, so please fetch me some water.”
</p>
<p>
    I sat up worried about my sons, and rubbed my patchwork beard. Perhaps stress had caused the seizure. They had not been gone long, but the visions during
    my seizure were frightening scenes of wolves, poachers and blood. Gabriel looked old. “Did they mean anything?” I wondered
</p>
<p>
    “Here you go, Dr. Allemanne.” A yellow-sleeved arm stretched into my tree, a cup of water at its end.
</p>
<p>
    “Th-Thank you!” I sipped the water.
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me more about Emywyn.”
</p>
<p>
    “No! I will not discuss her!” my anger sourced from a disinclination to humor the doctor.
</p>
<p>
    “Please, you must have had pleasant times. Think back for me.”
</p>
<p>
    I had no free will to stop the subconscious from retrieving memories, both visual and emotional of my wife. Only seconds afterwards was my conscious clued
    into its mischief.
</p>
<p>
    Nostalgia warmed my mind into a smile.
</p>
<p>
    “Emywyn and I met at university. She worked at the library, while I lived in the library. At the time, I was writing my thesis. I arrived at the library
    the moment it opened and left long after dark. Due to this routine I came to know the building’s deepest secrets and celebrated in its beautiful moments: a
    rare book discovered or young child creeping to a table with a stack of books nearly his same height.”
</p>
<p>
    Curiously, the self-concerned doctor had not yet interrupted me.
</p>
<p>
    “Precisely on the first Sunday of May, oh how I remember that day, a few weeks into this routine, I browsed the science-fiction section. Water fountain and
    bathroom breaks had already turned tiresome, so I stretched my white and grey matter among the farthest reaches of human creativity. From behind the dull
    colors of the extravagantly named books, shown two brown eyes, Emywyn eyes. A glacial smile formed across my face. A few hairs escaped their nest behind
    her ear and fell in front of her face. In a quick fluid motion, she replaced them. Her excitement of our mutual captivation embarrassed her and unsure how
    to respond she quickly continued placing books on the shelf as if nothing had happened.
</p>
<p>
    Yet something did. We both knew that.
</p>
<p>
    I followed her down the aisle, and into the next, awaiting another glance. But she was stubborn and ignored my obvious chase. So I turned to displacing
    books for her to reshelf. The long hours of study had quite incapacitated my social skills. I chose a systematic brute force approach seeking to repeat the
    process in hopes of similar results. Yet never would her eyes stray again into captivation. Aisle after aisle I waited patiently through the books.
    Finally, her stubbornness to recognize my presence gave way to frustration.
</p>
<p>
    “If you need help finding the correct book, please let someone on staff now. I do not have time to pick up after you like some child!’
</p>
<p>
    Now it was my turn to feel embarrassed. I retreated to my table, and gathered my things. No worthwhile study would have been completed that night.
</p>
<p>
    So a few weeks later, after avoiding the library, I had to return. My roommate was far too loud, drunk, and inconsiderate to tolerate any longer.
</p>
<p>
    As I sat at the table in the back, a curious book was dropped next me. While I perceived the book, and in the background began to process guesses as to why
    a book was dropped in that space at that time, my attention was focused on the final calculations of a difficult mathematical problem in front me. Once I
    completed the problem, the curious book slipped into conscious position, and no longer hummed beneath the surface. A few seconds this lasted, and enough to
    miss the girl, well the most of the girl. I caught her woolen legs rounding the corner of the shelves, and heard the squeak of a cart.
</p>
<p>
    In the book was a bookmark. I opened the book to a story of such obscurity that her vandalism may never be discovered. In the book was a scribbled note of
    letters and numbers separated with periods. She must have noticed my books on theoretical physics and logic, and now wanted to play host to a scavenger
    hunt. I obliged.
</p>
<p>
    I scribbled out the frantic telling’s of my calculating mind. Polybius Squares and Caesar Shifts, the Trimethius Tableau or the Vigenère Cipher. But the
    code was neither so complicated nor was it easy, but one devised by a librarian. I leaned back and breathed deeply to open my mind to its full creative
    potential. I stared into space. My visual memory cut off as I momentarily considered the enigmatic sequence.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly in front me, directly in front of me, there it was. The side of the book read a similar script of numbers and letters. The code was no code in the
    sense of needing cracked, rather a Dewey decimal assignment of a single book in the vast library.
</p>
<p>
    I snatched the note and ran off to the familiar aisles of 150.1952. Books on psychology resided at that Dewey decimal class.
</p>
<p>
    I rushed to the books aisle, searched out its discrete place, but the book was missing, a sudden end to this game thwarted by her absence of foresight.
    Someone must have borrowed the book.
</p>
<p>
    Then through the book’s empty residence, I saw her eyes staring at me, her mouth smiling, her face flushed.
</p>
<p>
    I leaned in and as our lips met with just a peck I smacked my head against the shelf, but a kiss soon followed after she hurried over to my row, giggling
    with delight.
</p>
<p>
    The missing book was Freud's <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em>. We spent the evening in that aisle discussing the book, our lives and in developing
    a mutual elicitation of addictive feelings reinforced by mutual presence, better known as falling in love.
</p>
<p>
    She wore red that day. Always, she wore red, as a personification of Goethe’s red which, “conveys an impression of gravity and dignity, and at the same
    time of grace and attractiveness”
</p>
<p>
    “And you married a few years later?” asked Samekh
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, and in just five years time I was a widower drunk with Faustian sons.”
</p>
<p>
    Up the walk came my peer, Mikhail, a man in his closing years with distinctive dress and demeanor. His expertly tailored suit shone extravagant against the
    background of the simple grey stoned church. He interrupted the conversation, for which I was relieved.
</p>
<p>
    “Good Afternoon, Mikhail, I am just having a discussion here with a Samekh. Why have you come?”
</p>
<p>
    “To coerce you from this tree and return to your family ”
</p>
<p>
    “I must be here to listen to Dr. Samekh who cannot afford to pay anyone to hear his problems.”
</p>
<p>
    The remembrance of my immense loss had depressed me into a foul mood.
</p>
<p>
    “Excuse me, I do very well for myself?” asserted Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail flipped a 1/100 geld out of his hand in front of Dr. Samekh, who snatched it from the dirt without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, Dr. Allemanne, please, end this ridiculous charade, and come see a real doctor, a medical doctor. He’s been my physician for years and will provide
    you the best health care in the world!”
</p>
<p>
    “I already tried,” commented Dr. Samekh.
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t need anyone’s doctor,” I replied.
</p>
<p>
    “You only stay there because of that awful bread you are eating. The rotten bread is rotting your mind!”
</p>
<p>
    “The bread is the best in the region, from the renown Renomme!”
</p>
<p>
    “Renomme would have baked a rat if it passed close enough to his hand. Now, come up out of that hole. We’ll get you some medication and tomorrow I’ll send
    you to the tailor. Soon we can spend the afternoon drinking fine wines and chasing some young woman, like the old days.”
</p>
<p>
    “Everything I need is here in my hole.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about your sons? Or are they also not yours, and you were a father only in delirium?”
</p>
<p>
    “The sons are grown and no longer need their father.”
</p>
<p>
    “A son will always need a father. This is life, and one of luxury and excess comfort. Now you sit in filth in a tree a beggar.”
</p>
<p>
    “A beggar with a coin is richer than I, but only in earth. I’m rich in spirit.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, so we have a new prophet. And where is all your coin?” Mikhail questioned with an anxious curiosity.
</p>
<p>
    “Indeed, he is a prophet!” realized Samekh, “he has visions, and writes with religious fervor!”
</p>
<p>
    “Gave it away, I don’t need it here. Saved only a small sum to get my boys accustomed to living without me. But seems they have run off on naïve some
    mission to bring us all back together”
</p>
<p>
    “You just said you sent them. What do you mean? Where have you sent them?”
</p>
<p>
    “East”
</p>
<p>
    “No. . .” Mikhail paused, and then continued, “they’ll surely die in there. No one, not even this eccentric fool of a quack can survive the tortuous turns
    ones mind endures within the forest.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Samekh oblivious to the comment, one that numbered in his or her life as a sand grain of sea, offered this, “He is right, Dr. Allemanne, the mind turns
    on itself in the manner of a schizophrenic or chronic depressive. Thoughts become conscious that drive and demand to end the conscious. Like a virus, the
    thoughts infect their host with such demanding and blind desire for dominance that it kills the host and itself.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is their chosen path.” I responded.
</p>
<p>
    “I wish I did not have to do this and apologize in advance. But this ends now. “
</p>
<p>
    Mikhail opened his mouth, but his clenched teeth kept the cigar in place. With gritted teeth he called to his driver a few hundred meters away, “Sven, come
    here and help me pull this fool out of this hole, he got himself stuck. Then we’re taking the car east today.”
</p>
<p>
    “I do not need to be rescued. I am in here in complete sanity,” I pleaded.
</p>
<p>
    “You will come out of that hole today and see my doctor once we find your sons.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sven come pull this doors open. He has it locked, but doubt that’s a problem for you.”
</p>
<p>
    Sven Nynkvist was a massive man, with an inverse relationship between his brain and brawn. He was dressed in a long woolen coat, navy blue. He had a hat,
    also blue, and a full, proud Viking beard reddened by Scandinavian genetics, which had also influenced his healthy girth and towering height. He always
    followed every minutiae order of Mikhail without even seeming capable of having an opinion on the matter. He would die— hundreds of him would die—yet no
    reader would ever feel empathy. Hans had blind loyalty, like a dog, but not even a half-smart dog will repeatedly bite its own tail.
</p>
<p>
    He squatted and tugged at the hinged root, reposed into pull of power. Dante had loosened the hinges that now strained under the weight of one Sven pounds.
</p>
<p>
    “Away from my opening. Do not touch my home.” I shouted.
</p>
<p>
    “You’re coming out of there right now. This ends today,” Mikhail demanded.
</p>
<p>
    “I’m a man of my own free will and separate existence, you have no right to remove me!”
</p>
<p>
    Then a sudden crashing, earth quaking sound erupted from within the tree, as Sven leaned back with all his weight, then fell backwards with a thick
    detached root in his lap.
</p>
<p>
    Light tore into the gaping hole of the tree. Sven stared in shock from his abrupt seat on the grass just outside the porthole.
</p>
<p>
    I seized, again, only a few hours recovery. I seized and thrashed.
</p>
<p>
    Sven froze.
</p>
<p>
    Across the cathedral lawn came Abbot Wilhelm, frantic and scolding, a fluttering of purple fabric.
</p>
<p>
    “Mikhail, I gave no permission to disturb Dr. Allemanne. We discussed this and you promises no more interference.”
</p>
<p>
    “But do you not see his sick and needs help.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t you see that he is in his under the care of the greatest doctor in the world, the inventor and designer of the flesh!”
</p>
<p>
    “That lets him suffer? He had another seizure and he may have hit is head. He needs medical attention. Sven, pull him out.”
</p>
<p>
    “Sven and Mikhail, you need to leave. Dr. Allemanne will be fine. This is only a test of his faith. I will have some of the monks tend to him.”
</p>
<p>
    Oblivious Sven, preoccupied Samekh and frustrated Mikhail departed my tree.

<p>
    Silence. The stillness ere dawn, all diurnal creatures await their waking, while the nocturnal never move on an audial plane.
</p>
<p>
    I breathed slowly.
</p>
<p>
    My pants were moist with the most unpleasant side effect of my seizures.
</p>
<p>
    I changed them in the dark.
</p>
<p>
    I tore off a piece of bread and ate.
