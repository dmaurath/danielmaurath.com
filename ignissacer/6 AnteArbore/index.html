	<div class="content">
		<p>The wealth of centuries, of my family’s history was scattered throughout my office. The impressive glint of a sword—light abstractions—retracted my pupils.</p>
		<p>The animal instinct is so involuntary. My frontal lobe relinquished processing authority to the primitive reptilian hindbrain. A match fluttered alit, fell and tumbled match head over matchstick onto my latest writing. The words with the obverse ease in which they were written, vanished. I grabbed the pages in front of me, to read them, to watch the fire read them, consuming each word leaving behind ash, the words transformed. The ignited ashes detached and floated around the room onto the threads of the Ferghan, woven in the year of the first crusade. Flames fluttered, entropic movement according to the dynamics of present oxygen and the health of the source: a one-of-a-kind rug formed into the holy tatters of the carpet of a downtrodden poet too lost in his work to segregate ashes to a tray.</p>
		<p>I became fixated on the loss of wealth before my eyes; the carpet’s reduction to a black worthless ash pile, carbon and smoke forever appropriated throughout the atmosphere, thrilled me. The loss of responsibility for an object, the anxiety over its preservation, the endless professional cleanings, and wealth put forth to protect this vault of wealth, excited me.</p>
		<p>I stamped it out! I rescued the remains! Not out of a return of a need neither to perpetuate this anxiety nor to continue to enjoy the constant upkeep of a museum piece, but because the same destruction could occur without such senselessness. Why feed all my possessions to fire when I could donate them? I could sell them to give my sons an insurance of a decent life, and donate the rest to caring hands. They could not be given to the government, or the ministry of a demonstration of the shortcomings of human nature, as the news so often inspires me to name it. No, perhaps an orphanage or a museum of the Allemanne family would be better. All will be donated, the history of the pieces taught, and the richness of the collection maintained in knowledge, not quantified currency. </p>

		<p>I took a step out the door, and down the stone steps. The blustery winds blew over the river and forced my body to a rigid bend, my shoulders hunched, face parallel to the ground, as the top of my head bravely faced the sting of cold.  I resisted the winds push and raised my head in a reverse of the rigid duck I was forced into earlier. I paused and became entranced by the eternal slow flow of the river a couple hundred meters from my door.</p>  
		<p>The humid sea breeze lulled me into a mind-wandering vision. In a single breath past my eyes played out the history of this river, a maritime battlefield of no match in history. Before my eyes castles fell; ships sunk; marauders came and went, drowned and pillaged; explorers arrived for the greatness of intellect rather than the greatness of the sword; barges replaced warships; garish tourist ships appeared; in a fast approach a Viking and his axe crashed into my vision!</p>
		<p>I opened my eyes and stretched up to see nothing but the historied river pushing on into a future far more enduring than mine.</p>
		<p>This section of earth had rotated away from sun, and darkness fell. Herr Lehman stepped out the gatehouse as I approached the end of the drive. He unfastened the locks and pushed the large iron gate open. Before slipping through the gap, I approached him.</p>
		<p>“Herr Lehman, hold out your hand if you would”</p>
		<p>“For what reason Herr Allemanne?”</p>
		<p>“Please, do as I say, the sooner you do, the sooner the answer is revealed”</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir”</p>
		<p>Into his hand I set a velvet bag weighed down by a decades salary for a gatekeeper.</p>
		<p>“Your services are no longer needed here, Mr. Lehmann. I appreciate the unwavering loyalty and hard work. Here is your salary in full for the next ten years, a wager based on the best guess I could make for how much longer I would have lived”</p>
		<p>“I cannot take this, Dr. Allemanne. I cannot accept a wager on your life. Excuse me Sir but I am overwhelmed at the moment. I do not understand.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, no need to understand, appreciate the mystery. Now see that this gate is refastened and I wish you and your family the best.”</p>
		<p>“But, Sir -”</p>
		<p>His voice quieted behind my hurried pace towards the Cathedral.</p>
		<p>As I crossed the city, I made a regretful decision to enter Reganplatz. I was an unarmed civilian in a swarm of enemy soldiers. From every side bulky bags and pointed corners of shoeboxes wounded me. Consumerism transformed into an army of senseless selfish robots battering me without conscience. I felt so insecure, so out of place. Not a friendly eye, yet here is happiness being bought by the bagful — happiness that will subside as quickly as the swipe of a card, unlike happiness of an experience, which is idiosyncratic thus resistant to the decay of social comparison. Like the hounds of Chateau Chaverny, a group frothed at the entrance to their next short-lived high waiting inches behind the closed store glass. Impulse abounds.</p>
		<p>Today was also a sports day. The city brimmed with jungle cries from citizens dressed for battle, in decorative patterns of three colors that solidified in-group membership, and some believed, superseded common decency. Halvemaen played against another city, which I lack the intimate knowledge of the sport (whichever one it was this winter season) to relate. Even in this state of omniscience, my apathy persists. A menagerie of players with no connection to this city played against a menagerie from another city, equal in vague connection. The result was Halvemaen cheering for a brand, the colors and shapes that never changed in contrast to the players who always changed. In a fault of misattribution, they believed love of city meant love of the brand, and sought to confirm their own preconception of loving a city with biased interpretations and memories.  They believed their brand to be the best becoming hostile when their superiority was not respected.  To the threatening mascot, the fans loyalty lied, and to ridiculous violence they defended the brand. Their testosterone rose and fell with their team, and like the rise and fall of musical notes, played out a tragic scene in man.</p>

		</div>
		<p>At the end of the <em>platz</em> was St. Anthony’s Cathedral, whose disproportionately tall openwork spires sprawled into the heavens like the spreading branches of a tree. The cathedral rested on the border of the far reaches of my estate and its muddy trails prevented swifter passage. The aged charcoal cathedral seemed a stone skeleton with a vaulted torso, cribbed flying buttresses and clerestory windows coming to flamboyant arches. St. Anthony’s displayed the underlying order and rationality of the universe in its geometrical and mathematical construction, and a collateral aesthetic of magnificence.  From the Himmelturm, or heaven tower, one could look out and see almost all directions the edge of the city as it met the edge of a present twilight sky. In only one direction, was the view hindered.</p>
		<p>The Himmelturm was shadowed by our Yggdrasil, so named for its similarity to the tree of life of Norse mythology, a <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em> or Ash tree of atypical dimensions. The pollard tree bulged at the bottom, and progressively narrowed towards the top where it became a thicket of branches. The arms were bare and stretched to all directions. Here I made my home.</p>
		<p>I knocked on the great doors of St. Anthony’s in hope the monks had finished evening prayer and could have me. I could not wait until the sun came around again.</p> 
		<p>The great door opened with the reluctance, speed and fluidity of a languorous giant. A modest monk in drab gray invited me in with cheerfulness unexpected of one in such ascetic dress.</p>
		<p>“Dr. Allemanne, if you are here for our latest Trappist brew, we will not open the cellar for another hour. But we are pleased to see you and have missed you the past few months. Is everything alright with your family?” 
I crossed the threshold and stepped aside as Luke shoved closed the giant door.</p>
		<p>“This is a time like none other,” I responded. “All is more than well. In fact, I have come to you about my family, and in regards to some other particulars concerning them. Follow me please, Luke” 
I hurried forwards in a fast walk that evolved into an elated jog.</p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne where are you going?”</p>
	<p>I traversed the transept, reached the end of the sanctuary, climbed up the stairs past the altar and slipped behind into a narrow passage, the <em>semita latenter</em>. The passage was but a few footfalls before I reached a dead end. Before me was a rod-iron ladder.</p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne, no has been up that ladder since I took my vows here almost 25 years ago. It is not safe! Please Sir, come down! Tell me what it is you wanted to say. I must be hurrying back to my chambers to prepare for this evenings Bible study.”</p>
	<p> The ladder held, and the height was dizzying, but the view spectacular.  Luke sat against the curved wall to the right of me with his legs scrunched and pressed up to his chest.</p>
	<p>“Afraid of heights? I used to be but now this height does not seem any higher to me than that first step on the ladder. Fear is only psychological and can be overcome with cunning.”</p>
	<p> Himmelturm had a large hollowed cone for a roof and earned its name from its 150-meter height, a skyscraper of its day. When the church had been built centuries earlier, this tower was not in the original design. Sir Edward Bakermary, a wealthy Lord, and avid Bible scholar in a misguided interpretation of the Holy Scriptures had it built. He built it taller than anything anyone in this part of the world had seen at the time. He built it to test God, just as the devil had tested Jesus in the desert. He invited Jesus to show himself the Son of God by falling from a great height and in doing so assuredly being saved by his heavenly father. Sir Bakermary did not believe he was testing God, only demonstrating his faith.”</p>
	<p>The platform was the shape of a toothless key. A round head, with a small opening that stretched downwards the length of the ladder, and a long rectangular stone slab, like a diving board extended from one edge to two meters out into the open air.  
Bakermary climbed the tower, said a small prayer then shuffled forwards to the edge of the slab. Afraid of heights, he rotated and then let himself fall backwards, expected to be caught by a gust of heavenly wind. His faith buckled under his weight and in horrid awe the crowd below watched him fall terminal at terminal velocity. They scattered, none brave or strong enough to break his lengthy fall. His petrified wife made no movement. All the weight fell on her, and together they were forced into the earth from whence they came, dead, in such tragedy. The church condemned Bakermary as reckless, and sought to distance itself from one who would dare test god, a god who valued mindless conformity and obedience of custom and authority over human life.</p>
	<p>I dangled my legs above the Bakermary’s grave, and invited Luke to at least turn his head out over the grounds, and my acres.
“See, Yggdrasil out there Luke”	</p>
	<p>“Yes, Sir, the ash tree” </p>
	<p>“From the mansion at the far end to the tree on the border, and all in-between, from the far fence out past the well,” I pointed west “to the iron fence below, that marks the border between my property and Gods, I give that to the church, to your church, Luke.” </p>
	<p>“That is a very generous donation, Sir. Abbot Wilhelm will be very pleased. We had been hoping to open a school soon, and were afraid we would have to relocate to an area farther away from the city where there is more land, but your house and the grounds will serve God in this purpose very well. You must certainly be a wellspring of God’s pride. I thank you. The church thanks you. That old ash tree will be the first thing to go. It has not shown a leaf in a score of years, and harbors only insects in its hollowed tomb. I fear it could tumble down at any moment, save for the thick trunk keeping it rooted.”</p>
	<p>“Yggdrasil stays. I apologize for not mentioning it earlier but the tree stays. Do you have any extra robes?”</p>
	<p>“Robes? Sir”	</p>
	<p>“Yes, a drab gray one such as yours. You must keep extras for those who may answer God’s call in the future”	</p>
	<p>“Oh, these robes,” Luke in his humble style pinched a section of the rough, dry, sackcloth forward, “Abbot Wilhelm should have a few spare in his office. We monks are not as neat as one may think, and this cloth although cheap attracts dirt far more easily than one likes” </p>
	<p>“Could you fetch one for me? I’m willing to pay. 5 Geld?”</p>
	<p>“Sir! 5 Geld is a year’s tithe for some of our members. That is not necessary. Your generous donation will cover the modest cost of a monk’s cloth. But may I ask for what reason you are requesting a robe? Your clothes are the finest in the city.”
“Here is 5 Geld, now I have wasted much time enjoying this spectacular view and must be off. Please hurry back with the robe.” I dropped the coins into the pockets of his robe.</p>
	<p>Luke’s confounded mind slowed to a pensive pause, mouth gaping, but I ignored them, walking to the edge. Luke descended into the tower.</p> 
	<p>I pulled my decorative kurta, a gift from an Indian prince, over my head, and tossed the kurta up into the air like a bird first learning to fly. In the wind it became an unmasted sail not resisting the push and pull of the wind. The garment settled on the grass far below, soon joined by the rest of my pretentious clothes. I stood at the edge of the diving platform, imagining a loch of the Scottish highlands inviting me from below. The wind gusts were strong and near constant. A thought of Lucifer’s, one entered prying and prodding in my mind, to test God, to lean forward just a little and the let God’s Grace assist in my defiance of gravity, but could not, for I did not harbor the faith of Bakermary. No I had an instinctual drive for preservation that lay incognito, secluded from the meddling of the dangerous consciousness.</p>
	<p>“Sir, Dr. Allemanne, please step back, my heart is pounding from here. I have brought two robes, one gray like mine and another purple like the Abbots, which I think may be a better wear for a man of your stature. I also insist that your previous donations are satisfactory. Please keep the 5 Geld, and insure a philanthropic life for your sons. I insist sir.”</p>
	<p>“No the gray one will do, and my sons have enough. 5 Geld will insure them nothing but material of this world. I ask that you take them in, care for them, and teach them of faith, and belief, which is the only currency that can buy what is truly important. I must go now. They will be finished with their studies, soon. Ill have Ms. Steinhurst bring them by.”</p>
	<p>I had provided Ms. Steinhurst with a salary, but for her projected life not mine. She became the legal guardian of my sons from now until her death. </p>
	<p>From the cathedral, I turned not right to home, but left to follow along the road that brought the wheat and fruits of the surrounding farmers into town. I once had not even considered a foot upon this peasant path.  Anytime I had to cross, I required my driver cover it in a rich red velvet carpet for my feet, which I believed deserved better than even the most clever peasant mind.</p> 
	<p>I wandered along the path for quite some time as the houses became less densely packed and gave way to large pastures with cows, goats and sheep grazing. Dusk came and went. Moonshine lit the path behind me. 
I had never walked so long and so far, not since I was a boy.</p> 
	<p>Exerted, I reached and rang the knocker of the Bauer household. Nothing.</p>
	<p>I knocked again.</p>
	<p>An inquisitive light came on with murmurs, then a loud, “Who comes by a tired farmers door so late in the night during the harvest?” </p>
	<p>“Dr. Allemanne. I could use a place to rest my—”</p>
	<p>“We don’t have your money! You took it all last month. We must live on the small garden in the back now.”</p>
	<p>“Please, I do not come to collect debts. Let me in, and let me rest a bit. I have business to discuss.”</p>
	<p>Silence until sunrise. I huddled next to the door in chilled reluctant sleep. </p>

		</div>
	<p>Before the sun, another light awoke me. The door creaked open behind me. A work-worn face, with permanent bags hanging beneath the eyes and a few gray hairs poking out around the chin greeted me in twilight of an important day. Herr Bauer, a man in his early looking 60 but actually in his 40s invited me in.</p>
	<p>I entered the modest house. Inside, there was a wooden table, nicked and dented with charming peeled paint. Next to the table was a medieval fireplace below many hanging black pots. The fireplace smoldered mild warmth in subtle reflection on the soot-stained walls. Simple and cozy. “ Please, sit down–Dr. Allemanne, you said?” Herr Bauer said.</p> 
	<p>“Yes, that is I.”</p>
	<p>“But you are dressed as Monk. Have you been drinking all night and into the morning at the Trappist’s and ruin your clothes? Religious men they say, but never seem to deny you drink or your generous offers of alms that follow.”</p>
	<p>His wife approached the table. “Would you like a drink, all I have to offer is peasants brew?”</p>
	<p>“I find that quite apt for these robes, a peasant brew sounds delicious.”</p>
	<p>She brought us each a cup. I took a long sip and felt the caffeine taking command of my neural chemistry. The caffeine binds to the neurons and blocks adenosine’s slowing effects. The block signals emergency and adrenaline and dopamine are released, a natural energized high.  </p> 
	<p>“No I have adopted a more spartan lifestyle, one that does not require such lavish raiment. I have passed my fortune onto the Abbey for their school and am here to cancel your debts and assure your children a proper education.”</p>
	<p>He rubbed his puzzled old face.</p>
	 <p>“Now, was it about 2 years ago that I financed your new barn?”</p>
	 <p>“I believe, so. We had Martina heading off to private school and could not afford both her education and a new barn. Then our prices at the market were forced down by competition from other towns, but interest on our debts increased. We had to borrow or fail.”</p>
	 <p>“Friend, and truly I mean friend, I regret that past of mine. I come here today to cancel that debt.”</p>
	 <p>“Sir I cannot settle any debts. I can barely afford my payments. Please leave, leave if that is what you are here for. Unless you want this shirt from my back. It’s soaked with more work than you have ever imagined behind your antique desk, golden pens, and wealth built upon the precarious backs of us workers!”</p>
	 <p>I let him vent. I let him express. Then intervened, not wanting him to be too worked up. Too stressed. I know how stress ages one. </p>
	 <p>“Perhaps you misheard. I said cancel not settle these debts and will accept nothing but agreement in this. As of today, all the geld you owe me is null and void. Here is all the interest that have you paid in full. I have no need for it. Thank you for the coffee. I must go and make many more visits.”</p>
	 <p>Herr Bauer transformed from an expression of desperate stress to disbelieving elation. I had no time and left him.</p>
	 <p>And on and on I went, house to house throughout the countryside. I visited all my debtors and canceled all the debts to astonishment, disbelief and at the end of weapons. My pockets lightened, as did my heart. A day later I entered town elated, almost ready to retreat to my shell. One more important visit remained.</p>
	 	<div class="dividerimg">
				<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/45564176@N06/5822085439/"><img src="http://www.danielmaurath.com/images/chapterART/infinite.jpg" title="Alex Akopyan" alt="infinte"></a>
		</div>
	<p>I entered the sterile foyer and felt as aesthetically pleased as I would in a hospital. The furniture was perfect but a style fitting of hotel lobbies and dim waiting rooms, impersonal and exuding corporate banality. Furniture for one who created the safe and overdone, with class of decades before, if one would even say those post-war decades had class. Not even dust seemed to have used the cloy flowers and dull patterns to rest. I chose to stand.</p>
	<p>The Mayor’s office, like the foyer, was elite but impractical, exorbitant but uncomfortable.</p>
	<p>“Mikhail, I am here on behalf of our farmers. They cannot afford the drive into Halvemaen. Many plan to cut themselves off entirely and only grow what they need, return to the simple life. This is not sustainable. The farmers supply most of the town’s produce. I have relieved all my personal debts, but we must relieve them further.”</p>
	<p>“Why are you here to discuss fire and brimstone? I have lowered your taxes further and now await the generous return to my campaign. Plus we receive plenty of canned produce.”</p>
	<p>“Have you ever tasted those canned vegetables? They are only enticing in their manipulative decoration.”</p>
	<p>“No, but the people don’t seem to mind it. Here have a drink Dr. Allemanne.”</p>
	<p>I downed the drink. The caffeine had worn and the alcohol would relieve the headache. In my previous state of mind, even a single drink would have been the start of a riotous evening. Now all had changed.</p>
	<p>“Unlike you, I am not motivated by altruism. I don’t succumb to the “good feelings” of “good deeds.” Disparity is the function of nature. A rabbit is born a rabbit and suffers a more miserable fate at the jaws of a wolf than the wolf at the jaws of old age. You see, we were born the wolf and must live our lives as the wolves, for it is nature’s structure. The farmers were born the rabbits and so live as rabbits, subject to every whim of our jaws. It is the pre-determinism of nature.”</p>
	<p>“But life is not so facile or disgusting. Martina Bauer. Does this name sound familiar?”</p>
	<p>“Bauer sounds a peasant title and that’s all I know.”
“Well, what happens when a rabbit becomes a wolf? She is the daughter of Henri and Hannah Bauer. They took a loan from me a couple years back to send her to university. And in her two years, she has already become a renowned scholar and leader. She is the top of her class and now earns full scholarship.”</p>
	<p>“A rabbit that dresses as a wolf, is still a rabbit, or is transfiguration an idea you also propose as truth?”</p>
	<p>“She does not attend the public university. She follows in the footsteps of this past century’s great leaders and attends our Alma Mater. She has her eye on politics too and seeks a better life for her parents.”</p>
	<p>“These tales of dreams reached and higher-class breached by lower-class is an anomaly. We designed the system in accordance with nature and so not even the quickest rabbit will escape the jaws of the wolf.”</p>
	<p>“Top banks and consulting firms have already tried to recruit her. They will not let this so-called quick rabbit of talent slip into the jaws of a wolf. She deserves this chance, and so do many others. I envision a society where all can have true equal opportunity and not the mere façade of it, as is currently propagated by politicians. We live in a society with burgeoning rifts that only hate will soon fill.”</p>
	<p>“Save your paranoiac thoughts for unread books.”</p>
	<p>“This is not paranoia. Her talent, her word, her story will become viral, will spread and infect the mind and push out the strict patriotic thought that permeates the misinformed. We do not live in a society of liberty, fraternity or equality. Illusions of safety have superseded liberty, fraternity is as empty as the regard two passing strangers hold for each other, and inequality emerges in even the most trivial ways.”</p>
 	<p>“While this all sounds unfortunate, you cannot expect me to shoot myself in the foot.”</p>
 	<p>“We both know you would suffer at most a prick. You have enough savings to live ten times as comfortable as the farmers. Instead you live upon them and the support is faltering. If I cannot convince you of change, then I am here to warn you of inevitable revolt and I hope this warning means bloodless revolt, and not a revolt ending with your head upon a stick. Martina is beyond violence but her story will resonate with all leviathanless classes that hone pitchforks as well as we hone finances. Though it is no concern for me. I have retired to a monk’s life and will no longer be an accomplice to this profligate existence.”</p>
