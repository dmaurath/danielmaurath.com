		<h1> eBook and eDits </h1>

		<p> I am working on another round of edits as I create an eBook version of the novel. It will be available in all formats this summer. </p>

		<h1> Ignis Sacer <em> Beta </em> Published: Read Review & Revise </h1>
		<h2 class="date">August 25, 2013</h2>
		<p> Any author admits a novel a never done, but at this point, I consider it at least ready for mass consumption. <em>Ignis Sacer</em> is not only a novel, but an evolving interdisciplinary piece combining literature, photography, painting, digital art, philosophy, history, and of course science. All images used in this site are under a Creative Commons license and attributed. A full listing of all works used can be found on the <a href="http://www.danielmaurath.com/ignissacer/toc/credits/">credits page.</a> 
		The site is imperfect. I did not use a template. Instead I chose to build a site from blank white space as a learning exercise. However,I plan and want to continually improve it and so encourage you the reader to help me. Please submit any bugs, grammatical mistakes, scientific inaccuracies, stylistic mistakes to <a href="mailto:daniel@danielmaurath.com">daniel@danielmaurath.com</a>. In addition, I will accept picture suggestions to further improve the visual experience. 
		Thank you for reading.	</p> 

	
<!--Synopsis-->
	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
		<p>			
		A wealthy but terminally-ill psychologist becomes a hermit due to ergot poisoning in a quasi-European not quite modern, not quite passed time. In his hermit's tree, he is often visited by his Faustian sons, a mosaic of a man, and his mentee, the mayor. 			</p>
		<p> 
			This is the story of the final weeks leading up to his death hinged on the discovery of a cherished painting: <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em> by Hieronymus Bosch.
		</p>
		
<!--About Ignis Sacer-->
		
	<h2> About Ignis Sacer</h2>
		<p> I sourced the original idea for <em>Ignis Sacer</em> from a dream: that ethereal place where we all glimpse the metaphor of reality. Through <em>Ignis Sacer</em> I sought to synthesize all that I learned during the intellectual transition of university into a fantastical and concise (under 50,000 words) philosophical novel. Like all labels, philosophical is only mentioned to facilitate a quicker understanding of what the novel holds. I drew inspiration from my comprehensive education in German literature and culture, and from a variety of other sources. A complete list of influences is on my <a href="http://www.danielmaurath.com/ignissacer/influences/" target="_self">Influences</a> page. Through <em>Ignis Sacer</em> I seek to encourage demystification of the natural world, and provide an detailed portrait of life inside ones head. From disparate words combined, emerges my homage to science as well an ode to the arts, just as from disparate neurons combined arose the words.</p>
		<p>This is a work of fiction. I do not avow to hold any opinions of the characters, and encourage you to take up any complaints with them in person through your own intellectual exploration. </p>
