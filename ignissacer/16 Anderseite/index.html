<p>
    A dim anomaly manipulated the otherwise empty horizon and took the shape of a city. The dense canopy loosened into a shady overcast. Sun streamed through
    the narrow slits and for the first time in over a week, natural light fell upon the faces of Dante and Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    They had traveled for three days since crossing the river – their lights long dead. Their pupils, not shy of darkness, had dilated into large black disks
    floating on the milky blue of their eyes.
</p>
<p>
    The eidetic view of Anderseite fluttered Gabriel's heart. He had stepped into one of his father’s paintings. Vivid green trees, rich coffee colored soil
    and an intense blue sky framed a majestic city of wood and stone stretching out into the river, vast but purposeful, a liberal blend of urban and natural
    landscape. Above, in the sky, whirred elaborate flying machines, canvas draped bats and engorged blimps. Below at sea level, a second city appeared
    wavering at the surface of the clean reflective waters that surrounded the peninsula. Mountains loomed in an apt milieu. A painter need not embellish to
    depict such a masterpiece of landscape. Gabriel and Dante stared detached from time.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you see that movement ahead? I’m not sure if it’s a side effect of my eyes adjusting or something actually coming towards us.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel saw a vehicle approaching them, not a car or a bike, rather something so novel Gabriel could not even offer a comparable vehicle from which to
    branch his description. The noun vehicle can only contain the <em>beweger</em> in a highly creative mind.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, yes, I do see something.”
</p>
<p>
    “Shall we run? I cannot imagine anything from this forest being pleasant.”
</p>
<p>
    “To run will invite chase, and we have been on a days long hike. It’s a race we would surely lose. I say wait here, and be diplomatic.”
</p>
<p>
    The <em>beweger</em> was an electric vehicle operating on the principles of photosynthesis. In person one could see it took the form of a leaf, floating
    comfortably above ground with a narrow aerodynamic head, like the pointed end of a leaf, which widened into a thin body stretching back to where a stem
    would be, it had been functional in a <em>beweger</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A man, in his mid-20s exited and stretched his hand to Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “Welcome to Anderseite” said the guide.
</p>
<p>
    His English was perfect but the accent foreign. No one Gabriel or Dante had ever met or happened to pass along the cosmopolitan docks in Halvemaen had such
    a strange accent. Anderseite as known in Halvemaen, but Terenverde in Terenverdean, an antique dialect of Halvemaen like Quebecois to French It was the
    most deviant from their accent harboring the warmth of the Irish brogue with no attempt to constrain a passion for life. The guide’s skin was golden, but
    not bronzed, a supple buttermilk color neither taught nor flabby. It exuded health, wellness, and youth. His features were an amalgamation of man.. Such
    peculiarity was not apparent to him. His hair looked to be long victim to poor genetics, but actually was never there to begin with. He stood an athletic
    two meters tall in simple clothes exhibiting idiosyncrasies common in garments made by their owners.
</p>
<p>
    Dante withdrew. His body language screamed uncertainty and doubt. Unlike Gabriel he knew nothing of Anderseite. Only rumors ever surfaced, and the most
    popular one being that those who enter Anderseite never return, but they were still reigns on a limitless imagination. Gabriel immediately came to think he
    knew why no one ever returned. For by this misadventure they are glancing paradise. Was the forest a purgatory? A dark, spiritual holding place with some
    torment but not eternal? How has he died? Again reins on imaginations are important.
</p>
<p>
    “What do you want?” Dante questioned unsmiling.
</p>
<p>
    “My ID is D02041987. I am an Ambassador to Terenverde, better known to you as Anderseite.
</p>
<p>
    “Your ID? Do you not have a name?”
</p>
<p>
    “My ID conveys everything basic you need to know about me in the most concise form. The number indicates that I am a native, and not an immigrant. I was
    born in the generation D, starting from A, year two. I am from the fourth sector, am first born with nine siblings, and am in occupation eighty-seven,
    Ambassador.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel asked, “So, Terenverde, what is this place?”
</p>
<p>
    Its true name is one you cannot understand without a proper education in our ways, without at least understanding our values and heuristics. In time though
    you can come to learn these things.
</p>
<p>
    “Now, please, tell me, are you Dante and Gabriel Allemanne?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes-,” hesitation, unsure yet if he trusts this strange man and his drivable leaf, “that would be us.”
</p>
<p>
    “Good, good, we have expected you. Now please follow me. “
</p>
<p>
    The <em>beweger</em> floated delicately without disturbing the surrounding air. The movement was effortless and silent. There was no driver.
</p>
<p>
    The vehicle sensed trees, and there were yet many, many trees. The forest was thinner than the sense-sucking opacity of the inner-Pfyn forest, but still a
    forest, as one who sees <em>n</em> number of trees knows a forest from <em>n</em> number of trees as a grove. There is a difference but only the
    subconscious knows.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Beweger’s</em> artificial intelligence was superior to the evolutionary designed intelligence of most small mammals. Although it took the extent of
    time from life’s inception to humans, there was through humans a capability to create intelligence in an exponentially faster way, and one that was
    immortal, well, relative to the quickly depreciating flesh. Metal would in time too deteriorate, but that’s measured in lives of stars not in the lives of
    men.
</p>
<p>
    The gliding weightless feeling exacted novel physics onto the boys’ bodies. Dante vomited, hardly to ruin. D02041987 had expected it and was there with a
    bag before the first dry heave signaled the imminent.
</p>
<p>
    “This happens to all on their first ride in a Beweger. Do not worry, it doesn’t happen again.”
</p>
<p>
    The vehicle stopped at the most magnificent wooden structure. The smooth outer shell consisted of a series of connected planks. From afar the pattern is
    obvious. The building is a modeled after the shell of a Schildkroete.
</p>
<p>
    They entered the structure. Inside was clean, monochrome and austere.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you plan to leave?” asked their guide.
</p>
<p>
    “ We only need to retrieve our father’s painting and then will be going”
</p>
<p>
    “Ok you free to go then. Follow the stairs to a hotel. There will be a state tour tomorrow morning at the point of your waking. At that time you can again
    to decide to stay. Young men with your skills are valued here in Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    “Decide to stay? Why would we stay? We are only here for the painting then really must return to Halvemaen. We must not stay any longer than necessary. Our
    father is sick, and needs us to return immediately. “
</p>
<p>
    “You have not had the tour,” replied the guide.
</p>
<p>
    “No and I do not see us needing it, please do not expect us in the morning. Where’s the hotel?”
</p>
<p>
    “Up those stairs.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’ve been most kind, thank you, a little for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel attempted to slip a few geld into the guide’s hand, but he outright refused, with a tint of disbelief mixed with a healthy dose of embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
    “Sorry, Your coin is worthless here. Now, I bid you farewell ‘til awakening. “
</p>

<p>
    Gabriel awakes, not to the streaming sun or bustle of a city below. He awakes to a lack of oxygen. Atoms of 8 find no room in his lungs. His blood runs
    blue. The soft feather filled pillow has been so easily transformed into an instrument of murder. He chokes at nothing. He chokes at the depletion of
    oxygen. His brain writhes, firing in a disrupted set, sensing its own demise, searching its memory in a desperate attempt for solutions: life flashing
    before his eyes. Gabriel flails, the back of hand knocks an iron candleholder into the wall. His muscles cramp with a surplus of lactic acid. The oxygen
    needed to break it down lies on the other end of the pillow smothering him. With a frantic grasp, he grabs the candleholder, and violence begets bloody
    violence.
</p>
<p>
    A bloody mirror image slumps to the side and off the bed. Dante lies in his suit of skin and bones, yet alive, but looking so dead. How curious death is, a
    deamination of a temporal corpse, a ceasing of a mystery, a misunderstood end for an even more perplexing beginning.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel bandages his brother and drags him on top of the bed. He cleans the blood, and showers and then departed for the curator, not without first
    noticing Dante had left while he bathed.
</p>
<p>
    The curator would be considered a busy man, if efficiency was not revolutionary in Terenverde. For the entire city was a work of art, and Kunst was its
    curator. As an architect of Terenverde he retained his given name for all new his purpose and history. In Terenverde all talents were equally revered and
    encouraged for there was a collective compulsive will towards equality and perfection in everything.
</p>
<p>
    Kunst welcomed Gabriel. “Here have this cup of coffee. The smoothest cup you’ll ever taste, untainted by the faintest trace of impurity. There is no
    pollution here, no waste at all. You’ll discover that during your tour. Now, what can I do for an outsider?
</p>
<p>
    “I am here to retrieve a very important painting that belonged to my father and am to believe you are the man who can tell me where the painting is
    located. The painting is Hieronymus Bosch's <em>The Temptation of St. Anthony</em>.
</p>
<p>
    “I cannot say I know the work, but speak to Gamut at the customs center. He may know where it went to after my tax appraisal.”
</p>
<p>
    “And can I ask if you have seen anyone else who looks like me?”
</p>
<p>
    “Like an outsider?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, and well, someone who may be my twin?”
</p>
<p>
    “Hmm,” Kunst’s eyebrows raised in sudden surprise, “no I cannot say I have. Why do you ask?”
</p>
<p>
    “If you do, please misinform him.”
</p>
<p>
    “I have to say I reserve the right to inform and misinform as any willful human does.”
</p>
<p>
    “Please trust me, it is for your safety. If you must know, my brother, my twin is after the same painting but for reasons governed by greed in which
    violence is quicker than tact. “
</p>
<p>
    “Greed? We learn all the common words of Halvemaen but sometimes they escape me. Is that a lust for possessions, for material wealth?”
</p>
<p>
    “Correct, Greed is a catalyst for the ugliest of evil and you will witness that by my brother, do not be an accomplice to his inhumanity.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ok, I have only a fairytales conception of violence, but will trust you on this else risk victim of my own naivety. My bet is in your favor.”
</p>
<p>
    “Thank you and I will be seeing you again.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel exited the curator’s office. A crowd marched in front of him, each one only following the one in front. He tried to slide through the strong
    current of tourists pulled ahead by those in front of themselves, but as he neared an end, an officer, whose tone and demeanor offered no room for argument
    instructed Gabriel to follow the crowd. Gabriel would be going on a tour after all.
</p>
<p>
    “This is not a commune, or a socialist state,” reassured the tour guide, “this is a society structured very similar to yours, however, everything is done
    according to the best possible way. Here logic and pragmatism not money govern.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel followed the tour group down a residential street with outdoor cafes, beer gardens, and trees. Gabriel had never seen such a city before. The
    street appeared to breathe, live and grow, albeit slow as a plant does.
</p>
<p>
    “In Utopias passed, there was no private property rather communism, no locks on doors, no privacy, all streets were the same length, houses the same size,
    each with just two doors. Clothes were like the grey skin of elephants, identical and only practical. A lack of any aspect of diversity resulted in a
    defectively dull and thoroughly boring existence. Terenverde is not a utopia. We have wealth gaps and unofficial classes. We operate on capitalistic
    principles and value individual achievement, but we are in constant state of change as our central computer, Fyodor, tries best to meet the needs of every
    citizen according to their ability, skills and desires. Our society is not influenced by the happenstance of birth, for all receive the same education
    and similar opportunities. They are thoroughly assessed and advised in all potential life paths that will contribute to the highest level of efficiency for
    the country. Religions are tolerated, though exhibited only by recent outsiders. We see value in a pious abstaining of meat or alcohol but don’t find these
    to be virtuous persons.”
</p>
<p>
    “Does anyone even work here?” barked an older gentleman.
</p>
<p>
    “As you noticed, all meaningless tasks are automated. Our citizens focus all their energy and work as wanted in expanding human knowledge. Many work in
    positions still too difficult to synthesize with a computer: Artists, Writers, Computer Scientists, and other creative professionals have proved
    irreplaceable so far. We are improving our capabilities everyday and expect mechanized creativity to be soon reached. This is not to sublimate natural
    human creativity, merely to augment it. Our end goal is a society of leisure governed by machines. Each citizen is trained to monitor, fix, and improve
    these machines and will spend a minimal part of their waking life doing so.”
</p>
<p>
    “Why not have the machines fix themselves?” asked a young woman.
</p>
<p>
    “We will have a series of machine fixing machines, but still need that security of human intelligence to ensure our best interests are maintained. We do
    not believe consciousness will arise in the machines, but must take precautions as consciousness a phenomenon not yet understood.”
</p>
<p>
    “Despite the presumed perfection of your society, there must be criminals. Where are they?” Gabriel asked.
</p>
<p>
    “Criminals are rehabilitated. But we would rather have none there. Our incarceration rate is near zero. You must be an actual threat to the way of life
    each citizen has come to expect here at Terenverde. Our reverence for education and virtual lack of involuntary unemployment allows only the most motivated
    of miscreants to emerge. Citizens have no reason to commit crime. All are invested in the whole community and it’s scalable. There is no more homogeneity
    here than the entire nation. There is no reason other than absolute greed to prevent its adoption.”
</p>
<p>
    “Not all criminals can be rehabilitated, some must be bad apples, forever poisoning society, “ said Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “Very few are ever that extreme, but we do have a few that have proved resistant to any rehabilitation. Randayn is perhaps the most famous name you have
    heard”
</p>
<p>
    Murmurs and shaking heads among the tour group confirmed the notion.
</p>
<p>
    “In case you have not heard the story, I’ll relate a brief version. Randayn valued his needs above all others. He was the most striking case of selfishness
    rising from incompetence. Despite all the advances in education and social support Randayn became a lost cause. He ruined his land by often urinating all
    over this plants out of idleness or trampled the plants before they could grow. Others tried to help him, but he was verbally abusive towards them and
    unwilling to cooperate, a slave to his impulses. For leisure he would wander the river embankment murdering frogs or any other creature that crossed his
    path. He never socialized with others in Terenverde, and the few times he did, was so loud and obnoxious he found himself soon alone, abandoned. So poor,
    friendless, a victim of a cognitive system gone awry, he changed criminal. He started small stealing food and beer, but it escalated quickly and he
    captured children, whom he made work on his incurable land and serve him, all to avoid his only superiority: stronger violence than children. He valued his
    happiness above theirs and believed his to be a moral high ground. The act lasted only a few weeks. Soon the charade of selfishness ended when the children
    wise to his many naps, tied him up and escaped. Like all irreparable criminals, he lost his rights as a human, become property of the Terenverde, and was
    removed completely from society.
</p>
<p>
    “Where do he go? Where did the criminals go?” Gabriel questioned.
</p>
<p>
    “They are removed and that is the extent of information I can provide in maintenance of their and societies’ safety.”
</p>
<p>
    “Was he executed?” asked the older tourist.
</p>
<p>
    “No not at all. He was deemed unmodifiable and housed in the most humane way.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about the others, how are they rehabilitated?”
</p>
<p>
    “We have a different forward-thinking legal approach in Terenverde. Criminals are the product of their development and our society does everything to
    promote that development. Whereas your prisons serve as impoverished mental institutions, we are future-oriented, so punishments are allocated to prevent
    reoffending rather than as societal vengeance. Criminal sentences are assigned according to his or her degree of recidivism. We use predictive modeling and
    actuarial tables, which have proven far more reliable than the worse than random performance of supposed experts and familial relations that infest your
    courts.”
</p>
<p>
    “That seems just like an extension of current law, which differentiates crimes of passion from crimes of premeditation, with the assumption that crimes of
    passion are less likely to be repeated.”
</p>
<p>
    “Very true, our scientists Bartle and Zotak have simply taken the status quo a natural step further, as they have done in their treatment.”
</p>
<p>
    “Those are Halvemaen scientists.”
</p>
<p>
    “No longer. They have come here to dodge the risk of the mayor or some other dystopian elite from using it to erase memories of their crimes. You too can
    stay here if you like.”
</p>
<p>
    “And what is this science of modifiability?”
</p>
<p>
    “Memory alteration. Bartle and Zotak realized that we already use drugs to alter our memories. Humans use alcohol to repress memories, nostalgia and
    embellishment to improve memories. But these are dirty inconvenient and unreliable methods, so Bartle and Zotak used biology and the theory of memory
    reconsolidation to create a virus that is far more precise. Drug addicts forget they are addicted, and violent criminals and their victims are altered
    alike.”
</p>
<p>
    “Is memory erasure necessary for all criminals?”
</p>
<p>
    “Memory erasure is the extreme. Our ethics compel us to modify behavior as little as possible to realign it with the norms of society. An average patient
    with low probability of recidivism and high probability of modifiability will first undergo feedback training. They are forced to experience but control
    their impulses. Impulse control is the only barrier between them and us really, between us keeping two feet on a tall building and jumping off. As a
    product of the frontal lobe, which doesn’t develop fully until adulthood, it’s the difference between risk-keen teens and risk-averse adults. ”
</p>
<p>
    “What makes a criminal unmodifiable?”
</p>
<p>
    “For whatever reason whether it is psychosis, sociopathy, frontal maldevelopment, or other problems they do not respond to treatment. Usually, they exhibit
    a form of frontal lobe dementia, deterioration in the orbital cortex wherein impulse control emerges. Unable to regulate their impulses, we must remove
    them. There are only a few of these but it’s inevitable, as we do not believe in the myth of human equality. Genetics and personal history forge a very
    disparate array of brains, with far different capabilities representing all points beneath the curve.”
</p>
<p>
    “This has been recognized in our academic system, but our legal system in Halvemaen is wistful, limited to treating only the legally retarded and children
    according to mental capacity.”
</p>
<p>
    “The solution is expensive and like much of science opaque to intuition initially, but our policy of indexing neuroplasticity has been far more successful
    than a folkish following of the human-equality myth.”
</p>
<p>
    The façade of Terenverde was its greatest proponent. The city though made of dirt, wood, and stone contained not a scrap of litter. Vandals had left the
    glass and expanses of urban walls barren, but Gabriel could not grasp a near perfect society without social injustice. Is not meager wealth and sadness the
    fuel of a poet? He was born into considerable wealth and considered an important position to be in. Not because wealth meant importance. He believed he was
    one of the few responsible to maintain the injustice that drives civilization forward. He was to choose what art and science was to be supported, and
    believed, in his respectable and reasonable conservative way, that this was the only way truly innovative projects would succeed. His thoughts compelled
    another question, “Then this must surely be a boring failure of a place. How can art flourish without injustice? What drives a man to dedicate his life to
    a specialized science when he can instead spend it in leisure?”
</p>
<p>
    “Curiosity,” retorted the guide, “curiosity brought this society from brainwave to reality. A young man, who amidst the birth of the industrial revolution
    chose to think differently, conceived Terenverde. He was borne by a curiosity that made him wonder if polluting power plants and foraging violently for
    fossil fuels was truly progress. That curious man, Neudacht, engineered this entire society, which progressed seamlessly from agrarian to organic, avoiding
    the ugly industrial adolescence in between. There never was an age of industry, steam, rail, steel, electricity or oil, only the age of information.
    Neudacht brought the printing press to this oasis and through his methodical design avoided the wars of belief wrecking the world all around him. The
    highest technology has been engineered into the ecosystem, with solar energy providing one hundred percent of the power and recycling at near perfect
    efficiency. Design is natural and uses little resources, hence the motif of insects or bones that defines Terenverde’s style. Curiosity continues to
    motivate Neudacht’s predecessors. True, innovation may not occur at the rate of an industrialized society. We do not need it to. The engineering has been
    so meticulously woven into the nature that improvements occur naturally as needed and problems are eliminated naturally as needed.”
</p>
<p>
    “What is there to do then in one’s leisure if there is no one to entertain? And no problems to solve?” asked Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “We are not a closed society and do enjoy the few imports of entertainment from Halvemaen that we receive. Much of our time is spent in the company of each
    other. We cook long, slow, filling meals, sleep often, go for long aimless walks, and almost everyone is involved in a culture or other social club. At a
    club you can practice and share your favorite form of leisure with others. For example, I am in a oratory and foreign languages club, which assist me in
    improving my performance during these tours.”
</p>
<p>
    “You seem to also import trash. I saw heaps of it floating on barges during my ride down here,” said an older woman.
</p>
<p>
    “Terenverde in its constant ecological mission, imports garbage from surrounding communities using the generated heat to efficiently fuel furnaces and
    stoves alike.”
</p>
<p>
    “Halvemaen has much to give. Disposable is a descriptor as popular as organic,” replied the same woman.
</p>
<p>
    “So still following policies here long abandoned?” asked the guide
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel answered this time, “Unfortunately yes. Halvemaens are infected with an accepted cognitive dissonance. They bemoan low wages yet want everything
    cheap, which can only occur with low wages. Glorified mayhem of the holiday season is taught and reinforced as a constitutional right. Exploiting a deal or
    receiving something free is valued and praised in pious fashion. They blame the elite for greed, but pressure the companies the elite’s run for better and
    better deals and better return on their retirement investments. The savings is not coming from the elite; it’s from their wages. Retirement is just to fend
    off death in a terrestrial purgatory, propped up in front of a television by drugs that only delay the inevitable deleterious ailments. Yet I am complicit
    in this crime of the potential of the mind.”
</p>
<p>
    “Here in Terenverde, we know that public policies should be judged on utilitarian potential, on whether the policy widens inequality, provides less
    opportunity to the less fortunate, relinquishes economic security, undermines civil laws and government, ruins the environment, or detracts from public
    health. Due to this, and a predilection for education and brain importing, we avoid a society so frivolous and profligate in its consumption, fueled by a
    deluded idea of superiority. Rioting for goods is no more advanced than rioting for food. ”
</p>
<p>
    “In God We Trust, whom grants us yearly avarice incognito as heart-warming altruism.”
</p>
<p>
    “Bartle and Zotak proposed unobtrusive feedback training to treat the primitive impulses but were threatened with imprisonment. That was the catalyst that
    brought them here.” “
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel came now to understand his father’s position better. He was reactionary in his renouncement of this society and past restarting his life here, in
    this seeming perfect place. Perfect defined relative to human nature. Or he was maybe profoundly sick.
</p>
<p>
As the tour ended, he asked the tour guide one final question, “Where might one see a certain piece of art from my town called the    <em>Temptation of St. Anthony</em> by Hieronymus Bosch?”
</p>
<p>
    “What was that, a painting you are looking for?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes I am looking for a painting, called the <em>Temptation of St Anthony</em> by Hieronymus Bosch.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’ll need to see Gamut in customs. He’ll know. He operates our automated system Fyodor, which evaluates all material goods that enter Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    “So you have not seen it on any of tours?”
</p>
<p>
    “Please see Gamut. Now I must go, my three hours of work are done.”
</p>
<p>
    Gamut only worked one day a week. One day a week for 12 hours he would contribute his fair share to society. So only one day a week were any imports of
    cultural import considered. Since today happened to be a day Gamut did not work, Gabriel rented a room at the local Inn.
</p>
<p>
    A beautiful girl, near his age read an ancient book in the gardens. He approached her.
</p>
<p>
    “Can I ask what you are reading?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m writing,” replied the girl in a pleasant statement of fact.
</p>
<p>
    “What are you writing?”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s a treatise on love. I can read you a bit.”
</p>
<p>
    “I would like that.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel sat next to the young woman, beneath a dim glowing yellow light that gave the pages an amber hue. Her writing was beautiful; her hands delicate as
    she smoothly yet effortlessly traced her thoughts upon the paper. Her pale skin lay mostly hidden under a tightly worn earthen gown. She finished the last
    word and lifted the pen, then spoke.
</p>
    <br/>
	<br/>
<p>
    <em>“One true love is one of many loves.</em>
</p>    
<p>
    <em> For one with love can everywhere find love</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> which predisposes belief in good intentions</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> and a will towards positive notions</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>colors all in a glowing halo of</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        optimistic presumption and positive consideration.”
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “That is all I have for now.”
</p>
<p>
    “Beautiful. Do you have any other writing that is complete?” said Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “I do, but have class very soon. Would you like to join me and see a Terenverde school?”
</p>
<p>
    “How did you know I am a foreigner?”
</p>
<p>
    “Simple. You look like one. Now I do not know much about Halvemaen, but from what I have heard, your schools resemble prisons.”
</p>
<p>
    “I am homeschooled by our maid and nanny, Ms. Steinhurst, and would love to see the school. But first, we haven’t met. I am Gabriel Allemanne, and you
    are?”
</p>
<p>
    “Alessandria”
</p>
<p>
    The first course Gabriel observed was a chemistry or a physics, or maybe even a biology course. The lesson was a project to use a concoction of chemicals
    that heightened the efficiency of the steam engine and could be recycled to feed and water a collection of plants. A problem that still needed a solution
    in Terenverde.”
</p>
<p>
    The next courses were in financial literacy, sex education, software engineering and writing to persuade organizations to donate money for the students’
    final special project. A special project was the pinnacle of education in Terenverde and produced the majority of innovations. The students could not fund
    the experiments themselves though. They had to compete for the grants of organizations. The best writing and ideas won the most grant money.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel had only intended to stay for a course or two, and meet up with Alessandria later, but had become to fascinated in the education system of
    Terenverde. Back home Ms. Steinhurst followed the curriculum of local schools, which required a tireless slogging through mundane history, memorizing
    formulas and answering questions to impractical problems.
</p>
<p>
    The last course of the day was a blend of history, political science and economics. The topic was the upcoming election in Terenverde.
</p>
<p>
    “Can someone tell me what day voting will be next month?” asked the teacher.
</p>
<p>
    “Saturday” rippled in earnest pleasantry throughout the classroom.
</p>
<p>
    “True or false. I can vote but you cannot.”
</p>
<p>
    A student on the right answers, “Presuming you passed the political literacy test you can vote as can anyone who has passed the test.”
</p>
<p>
    “I can?”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, you MUST vote,” replied the student “compulsory voting protects a functioning democracy,” he said as if a string had been pulled on his back.
</p>
<p>
    “Young man, which party do you follow in Halvemaen?” the teacher looked at Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “I am not old enough to vote sir, but father has favored the conservatives,” answered Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
    “The conservatives are one of only two essential parties in Halvemaen, and together they dominate the political landscape, choking outsiders like weeds,”
    lectured the teacher.
</p>
<p>
    “What parties do you have here?” Gabriel asked.
</p>
<p>
    “We have many parties, but only the parties care for the parties. We prefer to offer our citizens a variety of governing philosophies, understanding that
    only two is far from sufficient. Some parties have made attempts to combine to lessen competition and move towards the ineffective two-party system, but
    the TEC (Terenverde Elections Commission) prevents maneuvers that betray the intent of the political system.”
</p>
<p>
    Class came to an end.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Thank you for your invitation Alessandria. I hope I can one day return to this wonderful city. Do you know how to get to the importer?
</p>
<p>
    “Yes my father works there.”
</p>
<p>
    “Your father is Gamut?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, he’s the only importer here. A computer runs everything. He maintains the computer. What does your father do?”
</p>
<p>
    “That’s surprising you ask that question. I thought Terenverde was beyond defining ones identity always with work.” said Gabriel
</p>
<p>
    “We are, but are taught on how to converse with societies not as advanced as ours in order to promote humility and prevent arrogance.”
</p>
<p>
    “I see, my father was a psychologist at the university and amateur philosopher, now he’s ill in a tree. It’s a tragic story, but I really am anxious to get
    the import center, so cannot discuss it at the moment. I need information on a painting there that will help my father. Do you mind showing me the way?”
</p>
<p>
    “Sure, its on my way to the wine cellar, In Vino Veritas, where I plan to meet up with some friends from class. You can meet me there after your visit, if
    you like. My father will be headed there.”
</p>
<p>
    “I appreciate the offer, and perhaps if I find what I am looking for, I will join you.”
</p>
<p>
    “And how will this painting you are looking for cure your father?”
</p>
<p>
    “Its not a story I have time for, but can promise you I will tell it once this adventure I am on ends.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t make promises you cannot keep.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then I only promise that I will do all I can to return and finish the story. Might even have a happy ending.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel approached the import center, an automated covered bridge over the Stillfluss. Imports float down the river, the machines pluck them, inventory
    them, and then queue them for human processing, if needed. Despite engineering feats centuries ahead of Halvemaen, they did not allow the sentient machines
    to fully govern imports wary of mafias, cartels or other criminal activity common among a lower intelligence. The central computer, Fyodor, manages all
    imports but Gamut monitored its every move.
</p>
<p>
    Fyodor regulates all life in Terenverde using the intelligent predictive modeling of its algorithms to decide a citizen’s occupation or in governing
    financial markets, or guiding all the true automobiles, the <em>beweger</em>, in Terenverde. Fyodor is even the sole recommender of legislation, which is
    then approved or vetoed by a compulsory vote of all citizens of Terenverde. All is controlled by Fyodor except that which usurps freewill beyond the
    convenience of its automation.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel enters the center. Peace-bots, an automated security force surrounds him. He is arrested and placed into a cell that resembles a hotel room encased
    in a translucent plastic. A mouth-sized piece of he wall is perforated.
</p>
<p>
    A middle-aged man with a sandy skin tone of the poetess approaches. He is bald, tall, broad shouldered wearing a fitted black silk robe and black boots,
    the toe just visible beneath the robe. Gabriel is reminded of the rich coffee colored soil in the city. His eyes swirl an exotic teal. When he speaks, he
    is deliberate.
</p>
<p>
    “Gamut here, peacekeeper and customs. You ask too many questions. The people felt uncomfortable. We do not tolerate uncomfortable..”
</p>
<p>
    “I am only here for a painting, and is it not your people’s prerogative to question and pique curiosity?”
</p>
<p>
    “Rhetoric is ignored. Why do you come for this painting?”
</p>
<p>
    “It belongs to my father. He is sick and could not retrieve it himself.”
</p>
<p>
    “You’re lying. My sensors have detected all the signs to 95% accuracy. Your father is sick with ergot poisoning, true, but he will soon be dead, he’s
    terminally ill.”
</p>
<p>
    “Terminally ill? No he’s only sick from that awful bread he insists on eating.”
</p>
<p>
    “Incorrect, sir. Your father has a tumor on his liver. He has perhaps only months to live. He also suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy exacerbated by the
    intake of ergot.”
</p>
<p>
    “How can you know that? You have never met him. I am his son, he would have told me.”
</p>
<p>
    “Our information networks are pervasive.”
</p>
<p>
    “Will I retrieve the painting before he dies?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, he will not die, but he will not live either”
</p>
<p>
    “What can that possibly mean?”
</p>
<p>
    “Our systems are very unsure.”
</p>
<p>
    “What about the 95% accuracy?”
</p>
<p>
    “We do not avow to be soothsayers, though we make attempts.”
</p>
<p>
    “I need to leave. I must find that painting and return to my father. Can I please leave?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes...the painting...it was stolen.”
</p>
<p>
    “Stolen? Here in paradise?”
</p>
<p>
    “No. Certain groups demonstrate their disapproval with our society with attempts to undermine it. Our society attracts many wealthy individuals who bring
    their art collections with them. The smugglers steal the art and then sell it to your world. At first they made attempts to resell the paintings to
    galleries and collectors, but confronted an insuperable challenge of proving legal title, one of the three important aspects of any art’s value; the others
    being authenticity and provenance.”
</p>
<p>
    “So,” he said with a sigh, “they would sell the lesser known thousand dollar works in the local weekend markets and to unquestioning collectors. But the
    bigger works, the million dollar and often priceless works, were useless to them, not even on the wall, as smugglers did not understand them. And there the
    works remained, until one collector, a named Nathaniel Tyffyn established the Tyffyn auction house, a black market of art we have long sought to end, yet
    have been met by corruption.”
</p>
<p>
    So there was imperfection in paradise
</p>
<p>
    “Where are these smugglers at?”
</p>
<p>
    At one time they populated the mountains across the sea, and terrorized the city until the peace bots evolved. We have not seen any since, but this
    painting you are after is there to a 98.9% accuracy rating. Beware that these smugglers are motivated by only base needs so demonstrate quite primitive
    behavior. Legally, we consider them only complex automata, or beast-machines, or poachers.”
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel pondered. Hunting people. Evolving, living city. Rating accuracies. Neither dead nor alive. An AI superior to human intelligence. Beweger. There
    were so many threads to follow in what could be an extensive philosophical conversation on the merits of this paradise. His father dying alone. He felt
    rushed. The present pulsated rapidly into the future.
</p>
<p>
    “How can I reach the smugglers?”
</p>
<p>
    “Take a <em>schildkroete</em> from the port. We will escort you there, and you will need these.”
</p>
<p>
    Gamut placed a fistful of coffee beans into his hand.
</p>
<p>
    “We cannot offer you any protection in the mountains, and we do not have any weapons to lend you. We will return your pack to you.”
</p>
<p>
    “I will be more than capable of protecting myself.”
</p>
<p>
    “Even against your own blood?” questioned Gamut.
